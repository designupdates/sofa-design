  <strong>Tip 2: Choose durable and weather-resistant materials:</strong><br />

  <strong>Tip 3: Consider comfort:</strong><br />
  You want your garden furniture to be comfortable and inviting. Choose pieces with soft cushions and supportive backrests. If you plan on spending a lot of time relaxing in your outdoor space, consider adding a hammock or lounge chair.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Mix and match styles:</strong><br />
  Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles of garden furniture to create a unique and personalized look. For example, you could pair a traditional wooden dining table with modern metal chairs. Or, you could add a few colorful cushions to a neutral-colored seating set. The possibilities are endless!
