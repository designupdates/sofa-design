    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unaffected by moisture and pests:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unlike wooden or plastic legs, metal legs are not susceptible to moisture damage or pest infestations. This makes them a great choice for outdoor furniture or furniture in humid environments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fire-resistant:</strong><br />
    <p>

<h3>
  Enhance stability and support
</h3>
<p>
  Metal legs are renowned for their ability to provide exceptional stability and support to furniture. Here's why:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Strength and rigidity:</strong> Metal is inherently strong and rigid, making it an ideal material for furniture legs. Metal legs can تحمل (bear) significant weight without bending or buckling, ensuring that your furniture remains sturdy and stable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Wide and sturdy base:</strong> Metal legs often have a wide and sturdy base that distributes the weight of the furniture evenly. This wide base prevents the furniture from wobbling or tipping over, even on uneven surfaces.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Multiple support points:</strong> Unlike legs made from other materials, metal legs can have multiple support points. This means that the weight of the furniture is distributed across multiple legs, providing increased stability and reducing the risk of the furniture collapsing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Secure attachment to furniture:</strong> Metal legs are typically attached to the furniture using strong screws or bolts. This secure attachment ensures that the legs remain firmly in place, preventing them from becoming loose or detached.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the strength, rigidity, and secure attachment of metal legs make them an excellent choice for furniture that requires exceptional stability and support.
</p>
<p>
  With metal legs, you can be confident that your furniture will remain sturdy and stable, even under heavy loads or in high-traffic areas.
