  Ask friends and family

<p>
  One of the best ways to find free furniture is to ask your friends and family if they have any unwanted furniture. Many people have spare furniture that they're willing to give away, so it's worth asking around.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be specific about what you're looking for.</strong> Don't just say you're looking for free furniture. Instead, tell your friends and family what specific pieces you need. This will make it easier for them to find something that you can use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be willing to help move the furniture.</strong> If your friends or family are willing to give you furniture, be prepared to help them move it. This shows that you're appreciative of their generosity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Say thank you.</strong> Once you've gotten the furniture, be sure to thank your friends or family for their generosity. A small gift or a handwritten note is a nice way to show your appreciation.

If you're interested in a piece of furniture, arrange to meet the seller in a safe public place to view the furniture and complete the transaction.
</p>
