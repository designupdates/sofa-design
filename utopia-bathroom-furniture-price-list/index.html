  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong>

<p>
  <b><em>Answer:</em></b> Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability. Metal furniture is known for its strength and weather resistance. Plastic furniture is lightweight and easy to maintain. Wicker furniture adds a touch of rustic charm to your outdoor space.

  <strong><em>Question 2: How can I choose the right size garden furniture for my space?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <b><em>Answer:</em></b> When choosing garden furniture, it's essential to consider the size of your outdoor space. Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture to ensure it fits comfortably without overcrowding. Consider the number of people you typically entertain outdoors and choose furniture that can accommodate everyone.

</p>
<p>
  <b><em>Answer:</em></b> To keep your garden furniture looking its best, regular maintenance is key. Clean the furniture with mild soap and water and dry it thoroughly to prevent rust or mildew. If your furniture is made of wood, apply a sealant or stain to protect it from the elements. Store cushions and pillows indoors when not in use to prevent fading and damage.

<p>
  <b><em>Answer:</em></b> To protect your garden furniture from rain, sun, and wind, consider using a furniture cover when not in use. Choose a cover made from durable, waterproof material to provide adequate protection. You can also move your furniture to a sheltered area, such as a porch or garage, during severe weather.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find high-quality garden furniture at affordable prices?</em></strong>
