  <li>
    <strong>Withstands extreme temperatures:</strong><br />

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Water-repellent and quick-drying:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rain and spills pose no threat to synthetic rattan. Its water-repellent nature ensures that moisture beads up and rolls off the surface, preventing absorption and damage. Additionally, the material dries quickly, minimizing the risk of mold and mildew growth.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>UV-protected for lasting color:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Maze Rattan garden furniture undergoes a rigorous UV treatment process, protecting it from the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. This treatment inhibits fading and discoloration, preserving the furniture's vibrant hues season after season.
    </p>
  </li>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Durable wicker:</strong><br />
    <p>
      The synthetic rattan wicker used in Maze Rattan furniture is UV-resistant and water-repellent, making it ideal for outdoor use. It can endure prolonged exposure to sunlight without fading or becoming brittle, and it also resists moisture damage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>All-weather cushions:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Many Maze Rattan furniture sets come with cushions made from weather-resistant fabrics. These fabrics are designed to withstand rain, sun, and dirt, making them easy to clean and maintain. They also dry quickly, preventing mold and mildew growth.
    </p>

    <strong>Easy maintenance:</strong><br />
    <p>
