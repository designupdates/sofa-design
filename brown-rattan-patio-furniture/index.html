<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What factors should I consider when choosing garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When selecting garden furniture, consider factors like durability, comfort, style, and maintenance. Choose furniture made from high-quality materials that can withstand outdoor conditions. Ensure it's comfortable for relaxing and entertaining. Select a style that complements your outdoor décor, and consider furniture that requires minimal maintenance to keep it looking its best.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Garden furniture is commonly made from materials like wood, metal, plastic, rattan, and wicker. Wood offers a classic and natural look, but requires regular maintenance. Metal is durable and low-maintenance, but can heat up in direct sunlight. Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but may not be as durable as other materials. Rattan and wicker are natural materials that add a touch of elegance, but can be more expensive.

  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using covers or cushions when it's not in use. Choose furniture made from materials that are resistant to moisture and UV rays. If possible, place your furniture in a covered area or under a patio umbrella to provide additional protection.
</p>

  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Add comfortable cushions and pillows to your garden furniture to enhance its comfort. Choose cushions made from weather-resistant fabrics that can withstand outdoor conditions. You can also add a soft throw or blanket for extra warmth on cooler evenings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How can I keep my garden furniture clean?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Regular cleaning helps maintain your garden furniture's appearance and longevity. Use mild soap and water to clean most types of furniture. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. For stubborn stains, use a specialized cleaner designed for outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
