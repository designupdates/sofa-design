  <strong>Tip 3: Care for your furniture.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for many years to come, it is important to care for it properly. Clean your furniture regularly with a mild soap solution and a soft cloth. Rinse the furniture thoroughly with clean water and allow it to air dry. To protect your furniture from the elements, you can apply a sealant or wax. This will help to keep the furniture looking its best and prevent it from fading or cracking.

  <strong>Tip 4: Store your furniture properly.</strong> If you live in a climate with cold winters, it is important to store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months. This will help to protect the furniture from the elements and extend its lifespan. You can store your furniture in a garage, shed, or basement. If you do not have a place to store your furniture indoors, you can cover it with a tarp or plastic sheeting.
