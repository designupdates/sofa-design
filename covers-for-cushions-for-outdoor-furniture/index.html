A UV-resistant cover can help to protect your cushions from this damage.

  <li>
    <strong>Keeps your cushions cool:</strong> UV rays can also heat up your cushions, making them uncomfortable to sit on. A UV-resistant cover can help to reflect UV rays, keeping your cushions cooler and more comfortable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you live in an area with a lot of sun, it is important to choose a UV-resistant cover for your outdoor cushions. This will help to protect your cushions from the sun's harmful rays and extend their lifespan.
