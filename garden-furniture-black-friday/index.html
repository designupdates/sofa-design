<h3>
  Take advantage of store credit cards for extra savings.
</h3>
<p>
  Many stores offer store credit cards that can save you even more money on your Black Friday garden furniture purchases. These cards typically offer special financing deals, such as 0% interest for a certain number of months. This can be a great way to spread out the cost of your purchase and make it more affordable.
</p>
<p>
  To take advantage of these special financing deals, you'll need to apply for a store credit card. You can usually do this online or in-store. Once you're approved for a card, you can use it to make purchases at that store. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of the card carefully before you apply, so you know what the interest rate and fees are.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to special financing deals, store credit cards often offer other benefits, such as rewards points, free shipping, and exclusive access to sales. If you shop at a particular store frequently, getting a store credit card can be a great way to save money and get extra perks.
</p>
<p>
  However, it's important to use store credit cards responsibly. If you don't pay off your balance in full each month, you'll start to accrue interest charges. This can quickly negate any savings you've earned. So, only use a store credit card if you're confident that you can pay off the balance in full each month.
</p>
<p>
  By taking advantage of store credit cards, you can save even more money on your Black Friday garden furniture purchases. Just be sure to use these cards responsibly and pay off your balance in full each month.

  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are four practical tips for choosing and caring for garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right materials.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  When choosing garden furniture, it's important to consider the materials used. Different materials have different advantages and disadvantages. For example, wood is a classic choice for garden furniture, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal furniture is durable and easy to care for, but it can get hot in the sun. Plastic furniture is lightweight and affordable, but it can be less durable than other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Measure your space.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Before you start shopping for garden furniture, it's important to measure your outdoor space. This will help you determine how much furniture you can fit and what size furniture will work best. Be sure to measure the length, width, and height of your space, as well as any doorways or gates that the furniture will need to fit through.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider the purpose of the furniture.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What do you plan to use your garden furniture for? If you're planning to use it for dining, you'll need a table and chairs that are comfortable and sturdy. If you're planning to use it for lounging, you'll need comfortable chairs or a chaise lounge. If you're planning to use it for sunbathing, you'll need a chair or lounger that can be adjusted to different positions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
