  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've got answers. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about garden furniture, along with their answers:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: The best material for garden furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. Some popular materials include teak, metal, plastic, and wicker. Teak is a durable and weather-resistant wood that is naturally resistant to rot and decay. Metal furniture is also durable and easy to maintain, but it can be heavy and prone to rust if not properly cared for. Plastic furniture is lightweight and affordable, but it can be less durable than other materials. Wicker furniture is made from natural fibers and is lightweight and easy to move, but it can be more expensive than other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: When choosing the right size garden furniture, you need to consider the size of your garden and the number of people you typically entertain. You also need to think about how you plan to use the furniture. If you want to relax and sunbathe, you might want to choose a lounge chair or daybed. If you want to entertain guests, you might want to choose a dining table and chairs. Once you know how you plan to use the furniture, you can start to narrow down your choices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: The best way to care for your garden furniture is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. However, there are some general tips that you can follow to keep your furniture looking its best. First, clean your furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution. Second, protect your furniture from the elements by covering it when it's not in use. Third, store your furniture in a dry place during the winter months.
