    <strong>Cedar.</strong> Cedar is a softwood that is known for its natural resistance to insects and decay. It is also a relatively inexpensive wood, making it a good value for your money.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pine.</strong> Pine is a softwood that is not as durable as teak or redwood. However, it is a relatively inexpensive wood, making it a good choice for budget-conscious shoppers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition to the type of wood, you should also consider the quality of the construction. Look for furniture that is well-made and has sturdy joints. Avoid furniture that is made from cheap materials or that has poor construction.
