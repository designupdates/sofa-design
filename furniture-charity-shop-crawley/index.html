  Here are a few tips for choosing and caring for garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 1: Choose the right material for your needs</em></strong><br />
  Consider the climate in your area and how you will be using the furniture. If you live in a rainy climate, you will need to choose furniture that is weather-resistant. If you plan on using the furniture for entertaining, you will need to choose furniture that is durable and easy to clean.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 4: Care for your garden furniture regularly</em></strong><br />
  To keep your garden furniture looking its best, you need to care for it regularly. This includes cleaning the furniture with a mild soap and water solution, protecting it from the elements, and storing it in a dry place during the winter months.
