</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Round pads:</strong><br />
    <p>
      These are the most common type of rubber furniture pad, suitable for most furniture legs. They come in various diameters to accommodate different leg sizes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Square pads:</strong><br />

<h3>
  Non-slip and anti-vibration
</h3>
<p>
  Rubber furniture pads excel in providing both non-slip and anti-vibration properties, enhancing the safety and stability of your furniture.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Non-slip:</strong><br />
    <p>
      The rubber material of the pads creates a strong grip between the furniture and the floor, preventing unwanted movement or slipping. This is especially important for furniture items that are frequently used, such as chairs and tables, as it reduces the risk of accidents and injuries.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anti-vibration:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rubber's inherent shock-absorbing properties effectively dampen vibrations caused by furniture movement or heavy objects being placed on it. This helps to reduce noise and protect your floors from potential damage caused by vibrations.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  With rubber furniture pads, you can enjoy a safer and more comfortable living space, free from the worry of slipping furniture or annoying vibrations.
</p>
<h3>
  Versatile for various surfaces
</h3>
<p>
  Rubber furniture pads are remarkably versatile and can be used on a wide range of flooring surfaces, providing effective protection for all types of floors.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Hardwood floors:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rubber furniture pads are ideal for hardwood floors as they prevent scratches, dents, and scuffs caused by furniture movement. The non-slip properties of the pads also help to keep furniture in place, reducing the risk of accidents.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Laminate floors:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rubber furniture pads provide similar protection for laminate floors, safeguarding them from scratches and wear. The pads also help to prevent the laminate flooring from buckling or warping due to moisture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tile floors:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rubber furniture pads can be used on tile floors to protect them from scratches and chips. The pads also help to reduce noise caused by furniture movement on hard tile surfaces.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Carpet floors:</strong><br />
    <p>
      While rubber furniture pads are not typically used on carpet floors, they can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, they can be used under heavy furniture items to prevent indentations in the carpet.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
