This gives the table the look and feel of solid wood at a fraction of the cost. Cult Furniture uses veneers from a variety of wood species, including oak, walnut, and mahogany, so you can find a veneered wood table that perfectly matches your desired aesthetic.
</p>
<p>

Cult Furniture uses a variety of durable metals for their dining tables, including iron, steel, and aluminum. Each metal has its own unique look and feel, so you can choose a metal table that complements your existing decor.
