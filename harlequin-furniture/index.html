Marquetry is also a very versatile technique, and it can be used on a variety of furniture pieces, from chairs and tables to cabinets and chests.
</p>
<p>
  Today, marquetry is still used by skilled artisans to create beautiful and unique furniture pieces. While traditional marquetry techniques are still employed, contemporary artisans are also experimenting with new and innovative materials and techniques to create truly stunning works of art. Marquetry furniture is a perfect choice for those who appreciate fine craftsmanship and want to add a touch of elegance and sophistication to their living space.
