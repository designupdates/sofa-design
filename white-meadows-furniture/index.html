  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  If you have questions about garden furniture, you've come to the right place. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: The best material for garden furniture depends on your specific needs and preferences. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal is another popular option because it is strong and weather-resistant, but it can get hot in the sun. Plastic is a low-maintenance option that is available in a variety of colors and styles, but it may not be as durable as wood or metal.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: When choosing the right size garden furniture, it is important to consider the size of your garden and the number of people you typically entertain. You should also think about the activities you plan to do in your garden, such as dining, lounging, or sunbathing. Once you have considered these factors, you can start to narrow down your options.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What are some tips for maintaining garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
