  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. Measure the available space and choose furniture that fits comfortably without overcrowding the area. Also, think about the proportions of the furniture in relation to the size of your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Regular cleaning and maintenance will help extend the life of your garden furniture. Most materials can be cleaned with mild soap and water. Teak furniture requires occasional oiling to maintain its natural finish. Wicker and rattan furniture can be vacuumed or brushed to remove dirt and debris.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: It depends on the material of your furniture and the climate in your area. Teak, acacia, and eucalyptus furniture can typically withstand outdoor conditions all year round. Wicker and rattan furniture may need to be covered or stored indoors during harsh weather. Aluminum and wrought iron furniture can rust if left exposed to moisture for extended periods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How do I style my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Accessorize your garden furniture with cushions, throws, and pillows to add comfort and style. Choose colors and patterns that complement your outdoor dÃ©cor and create a cohesive look. Consider adding plants and flowers around your furniture to bring a touch of nature to your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find quality garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Look for reputable furniture stores or online retailers that specialize in outdoor furniture. Read customer reviews and compare prices to find the best deals. Consider visiting showrooms to see the furniture in person before making a purchase.
