  <strong><em>Tips for Maintaining and Enjoying Your Garden Furniture</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 1: Choose the Right Material</em></strong><br />
  When selecting garden furniture, consider the material's durability, weather resistance, and maintenance requirements. Choose materials like teak, acacia, or synthetic materials that can withstand outdoor conditions and require minimal upkeep.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 2: Protect from the Elements</em></strong><br />
  Protect your garden furniture from rain, excessive sun exposure, and strong winds. Use protective covers or store furniture indoors or under cover during harsh weather conditions. Applying sealants or stains can also enhance protection against moisture and UV damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 3: Regular Cleaning and Maintenance</em></strong><br />
  Regular cleaning helps maintain the appearance and longevity of your garden furniture. Use mild soap and water to clean surfaces, and avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. For deeper cleaning, consider using a pressure washer, but be sure to use a low-pressure setting to prevent damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 4: Store Properly During Off-Season</em></strong><br />
  During the off-season, store your garden furniture in a dry and protected area. Cover it with tarps or furniture covers to prevent dust and moisture accumulation. If possible, store furniture indoors or under a covered patio to provide maximum protection from the elements.
</p>
