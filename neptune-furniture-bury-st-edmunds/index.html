  <strong>Tip 2: Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Teak is a durable and weather-resistant wood, but it can be expensive. Aluminum is lightweight and rust-resistant, but it can be cold to the touch. Wicker is a natural material that is both comfortable and stylish, but it can be damaged by rain and sun.

  <strong>Tip 3: Measure your space.</strong> Before you buy any garden furniture, measure the space where you plan to put it. This will help you avoid buying furniture that is too big or too small.
</p>
