<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Prepare Thoroughly:</strong><br />
  Proper preparation is key to a successful paint job. Clean your garden furniture thoroughly to remove dirt, grease, and flaking paint. For bare wood surfaces, apply a primer to ensure better paint adhesion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Use a Quality Brush or Roller:</strong><br />
  Invest in good-quality brushes or rollers specifically designed for outdoor paint application. This will help you achieve a smooth, even finish without streaks or brush marks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Apply Thin Coats:</strong><br />
  Instead of applying one thick coat, opt for two or three thin coats. This allows each layer to dry properly and prevents the paint from becoming too thick and prone to peeling.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Allow Sufficient Drying Time:</strong><br />
  Be patient and allow each coat of paint to dry thoroughly before applying the next. Rushing the process can result in a compromised finish and may require additional coats.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 6: Protect Your Painted Furniture:</strong><br />
  Once your furniture is painted, protect it from the elements with a clear sealant or varnish. This will help extend the life of the paint finish and keep your furniture looking its best.
</p>
<p>
  Following these tips will ensure a professional-looking finish and long-lasting protection for your garden furniture.
</p>
<p>
  With careful preparation, proper application, and a touch of patience, you can transform your garden furniture into beautiful and durable pieces that enhance your outdoor living space for seasons to come.
