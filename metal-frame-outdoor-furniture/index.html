</p>
<h3>
  Weather-resistant
</h3>
<p>
  Metal frame outdoor furniture excels in its ability to withstand the elements, making it an ideal choice for outdoor spaces exposed to various weather conditions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to rust and corrosion</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unlike other materials such as iron or steel, which are prone to rusting, metal frames are typically made from aluminum, stainless steel, or wrought iron, which are highly resistant to corrosion and rust. This ensures that your furniture remains intact and visually appealing even in humid or coastal environments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>UV-resistant</strong><br />
    <p>
      Prolonged exposure to the sun's UV rays can cause fading and deterioration in many materials. However, metal frames are typically treated with UV-resistant coatings or finishes, protecting them from the sun's harmful rays and preserving their color and appearance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Withstands extreme temperatures</strong><br />
    <p>
      Metal frames can withstand extreme temperatures, both hot and cold. They will not warp or crack due to heat or become brittle in cold weather, ensuring that your furniture remains comfortable and functional all year round.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Water-resistant</strong><br />
    <p>
      Metal frames are water-resistant, meaning they can withstand rain, snow, and other moisture without becoming damaged. This makes them an excellent choice for outdoor spaces that experience frequent precipitation.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No need for painting or sealing</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unlike wooden outdoor furniture, which requires regular painting or sealing to protect it from the elements, metal frames do not require such maintenance. They are typically treated with durable finishes that protect them from rust and corrosion, ensuring that they retain their appearance for years to come.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy to clean</strong><br />
    <p>
      Metal frame outdoor furniture is easy to clean and maintain. Regular cleaning with a mild soap solution and a soft cloth is sufficient to keep your furniture looking its best. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish of the metal.
