  In Indonesia, political parties must meet a certain threshold in order to contest elections. This threshold, known as the "House of 20," was introduced in 2008 as part of a series of political and administrative changes.
</p>
<p>
  The House of 20 requires that a political party win at least 20% of the national vote or 20 seats in the People's Assembly (DPR) in order to participate in elections. This threshold is designed to ensure that only the most popular parties are represented in the Parliament and to reduce the number of small, fragmented parties that have historically made it difficult to form stable governments.
</p>
<h2>
  House of Twenty
</h2>
<p>
  The House of Twenty is a term used to describe the electoral threshold in Indonesia, which requires political parties to win at least 20% of the national vote or 20 seats in the People's Assembly (DPR) in order to participate in general elections.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>20% national vote
  </li>
  <li>20 DPR seats
  </li>
  <li>Introduced in 2008
  </li>
  <li>Reduced party fragmentation
  </li>
  <li>Ensured only major parties represented
  </li>
  <li>Facilitated stable government
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The House of Twenty has been controversial, with some arguing that it is undemocratic and prevents smaller parties from participating in the political process. However, others argue that it is necessary to ensure stability and prevent the proliferation of small, fragmented parties.
</p>
<h3>
  20% national vote
</h3>
<p>
  One of the key provisions of the House of Twenty is that political parties must win at least 20% of the national vote in order to participate in general elections.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ensures only major parties represented</strong><br />
    <p>
      This provision is designed to ensure that only the most popular and well-supported parties are represented in the People's Assembly (DPR). This helps to reduce party fragmentation and makes it easier to form stable governments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents proliferation of small parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      Indonesia has a long history of political fragmentation, with dozens of small parties competing for votes. The 20% national vote threshold helps to prevent the proliferation of these small parties and ensures that only the most viable parties are able to contest elections.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Promotes stability</strong><br />
    <p>
      By reducing party fragmentation and ensuring that only major parties are represented in the DPR, the 20% national vote threshold helps to promote stability in the Indonesian political system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenges for smaller parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      However, the 20% national vote threshold can also pose challenges for smaller parties, which may have difficulty meeting this threshold. This can limit their ability to participate in the political process and represent the interests of their constituents.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the 20% national vote threshold is a key provision of the House of Twenty that has helped to reduce party fragmentation, ensure that only major parties are represented in the DPR, and promote stability in the Indonesian political system.
</p>
<h3>
  20 DPR seats
</h3>
<p>
  Another key provision of the House of Twenty is that political parties must win at least 20 seats in the People's Assembly (DPR) in order to participate in general elections.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ensures geographic representation</strong><br />
    <p>
      The DPR is elected using a proportional representation system, which means that seats are allocated to parties based on the percentage of votes they receive. The 20-seat threshold ensures that parties have a broad base of support and are not concentrated in a single region of the country.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents domination by single party</strong><br />
    <p>
      Indonesia has a history of being dominated by a single political party, the Golkar Party. The 20-seat threshold helps to prevent any single party from dominating the DPR and ensures that there is a diversity of voices represented in the legislature.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Promotes coalition-building</strong><br />
    <p>
      Because no single party is likely to win 20 seats on its own, the 20-seat threshold encourages parties to form coalitions in order to meet the threshold. This helps to promote cooperation and consensus-building among political parties.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Challenges for smaller parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      However, the 20-seat threshold can also pose challenges for smaller parties, which may have difficulty winning enough seats to meet the threshold. This can limit their ability to participate in the political process and represent the interests of their constituents.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the 20-seat DPR threshold is a key provision of the House of Twenty that has helped to ensure geographic representation, prevent domination by a single party, promote coalition-building, and ensure a diversity of voices in the DPR.
</p>
<h3>
  Introduced in 2008
</h3>
<p>
  The House of Twenty was introduced in 2008 as part of a series of political and administrative reforms aimed at strengthening Indonesia's democracy and political system.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to 2008, Indonesia had a very low electoral threshold, which allowed dozens of small parties to participate in elections. This led to a highly fragmented political landscape and made it difficult to form stable governments.
</p>
<p>
  The House of Twenty was introduced to address these problems by raising the electoral threshold and reducing the number of small parties in the DPR. This was seen as a necessary step to strengthen the Indonesian political system and promote stability.
</p>
<p>
  The introduction of the House of Twenty has had a significant impact on Indonesian politics. It has reduced party fragmentation, made it easier to form stable governments, and ensured that only the most popular and well-supported parties are represented in the DPR.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the introduction of the House of Twenty in 2008 was a major turning point in Indonesian politics. It has helped to strengthen the country's democracy and political system and has made it easier to form stable governments.
</p>
<h3>
  Reduced party fragmentation
</h3>
<p>
  One of the key benefits of the House of Twenty is that it has helped to reduce party fragmentation in Indonesia.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fewer small parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      Prior to the introduction of the House of Twenty, Indonesia had a very low electoral threshold, which allowed dozens of small parties to participate in elections. This led to a highly fragmented political landscape and made it difficult to form stable governments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More stable coalitions</strong><br />
    <p>
      The House of Twenty has raised the electoral threshold, which has made it more difficult for small parties to win seats in the DPR. This has led to a reduction in party fragmentation and has made it easier for parties to form stable coalitions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stronger parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      The House of Twenty has also helped to strengthen political parties in Indonesia. By raising the electoral threshold, the House of Twenty has forced parties to merge and consolidate in order to meet the threshold. This has led to the creation of stronger, more viable parties that are better able to represent the interests of their constituents.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More efficient government</strong><br />
    <p>
      The reduction in party fragmentation has also made the Indonesian government more efficient. With fewer parties to negotiate with, the government is able to make decisions more quickly and effectively.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the House of Twenty has helped to reduce party fragmentation in Indonesia, which has led to more stable coalitions, stronger parties, and a more efficient government.
</p>
<h3>
  Ensured only major parties represented
</h3>
<p>
  Another key benefit of the House of Twenty is that it has helped to ensure that only major parties are represented in the DPR.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced influence of small parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      Prior to the introduction of the House of Twenty, small parties had a disproportionate amount of influence in the DPR. This was because the low electoral threshold allowed them to win seats even if they only received a small percentage of the vote.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More stable government</strong><br />
    <p>
      The House of Twenty has raised the electoral threshold, which has made it more difficult for small parties to win seats in the DPR. This has led to a reduction in the influence of small parties and has made the government more stable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Better representation of major parties</strong><br />
    <p>
      The House of Twenty has also helped to ensure that major parties are better represented in the DPR. This is because the higher electoral threshold makes it more difficult for small parties to win seats, which means that major parties are more likely to win the majority of seats in the DPR.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More effective policymaking</strong><br />
    <p>
      The fact that only major parties are represented in the DPR has also made it more effective at passing legislation. This is because major parties are more likely to have the support of the majority of the population, which means that they are able to pass laws that are more likely to be supported by the people.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the House of Twenty has helped to ensure that only major parties are represented in the DPR, which has led to a more stable government, better representation of major parties, and more effective policymaking.
</p>
<h3>
  Facilitated stable government
</h3>
<p>
  One of the most important benefits of the House of Twenty is that it has helped to facilitate stable government in Indonesia.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced coalition instability</strong><br />
    <p>
      Prior to the introduction of the House of Twenty, Indonesia had a very unstable coalition government. This was because the low electoral threshold allowed dozens of small parties to participate in elections, which made it difficult to form stable coalitions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More stable coalitions</strong><br />
    <p>
      The House of Twenty has raised the electoral threshold, which has made it more difficult for small parties to win seats in the DPR. This has led to a reduction in the number of parties in the DPR and has made it easier to form stable coalitions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stronger government</strong><br />
    <p>
      The more stable coalitions that have been formed since the introduction of the House of Twenty have led to a stronger government. This is because the government is now able to make decisions more quickly and effectively.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Improved economic performance</strong><br />
    <p>
      The stability of the government has also led to improved economic performance. This is because investors are more likely to invest in a country with a stable government.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the House of Twenty has helped to facilitate stable government in Indonesia, which has led to more stable coalitions, a stronger government, and improved economic performance.
