  <strong>Tip 3: Create a cohesive look:</strong><br />

<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your furniture regularly:</strong><br />
  Regular maintenance is essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best and extend its lifespan. Clean it regularly with mild soap and water, apply protective coatings or sealants as needed, and store it indoors or use covers during harsh weather conditions to prevent damage.
