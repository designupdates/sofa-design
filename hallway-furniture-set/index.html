    <strong>Materials</strong><br />

  <li>
    <strong>Construction</strong><br />
    The construction of the set will also affect its durability. Make sure that the set is well-constructed and that the joints are sturdy. A set that is made with dovetail joints or mortise and tenon joints will be more durable than a set that is made with nails or screws.

  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Here are some frequently asked questions about garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are used to make garden furniture?</em></strong><br />

Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture, as it is durable and can be stained or painted to match any décor. Metal furniture is also durable and easy to clean, but it can be heavy and may heat up in the sun. Plastic furniture is lightweight and affordable, but it may not be as durable as wood or metal furniture. Wicker furniture is made from woven rattan or bamboo, and it is lightweight and comfortable, but it may not be as durable as other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What style of garden furniture should I choose?</em></strong><br />
  The style of garden furniture you choose will depend on your personal taste and the overall style of your outdoor space. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose classic wooden furniture with clean lines. If you have a more modern home, you may want to choose metal furniture with a sleek design. If you have a small outdoor space, you may want to choose lightweight plastic furniture that can be easily moved around.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  The best way to care for your garden furniture is to clean it regularly and protect it from the elements. To clean your furniture, simply use a mild soap and water solution and a soft cloth. To protect your furniture from the elements, cover it with a tarp or store it in a shed or garage during the off-season.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How long will my garden furniture last?</em></strong><br />
  The lifespan of your garden furniture will depend on the material it is made from and how well you care for it. Wood furniture can last for many years if it is properly sealed and protected from the elements. Metal furniture can also last for many years, but it may need to be repainted or refinished occasionally. Plastic furniture is less durable than wood or metal furniture, but it is also less expensive. Wicker furniture can last for several years, but it may need to be replaced more often than other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Where can I buy garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  You can buy garden furniture from a variety of retailers, including home improvement stores, furniture stores, and online retailers. If you're not sure where to start, you can search for "garden furniture" online or in your local phone book.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How much should I spend on garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  The amount you spend on garden furniture will depend on your budget and needs. If you're on a tight budget, you can find affordable plastic furniture or used furniture. If you're looking for high-quality furniture that will last for many years, you can expect to pay more.
