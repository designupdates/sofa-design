<h3>
  Choose the right size for your furniture
</h3>

</p>
<p>
  To choose the right size for your chair covers, measure the width, depth, and height of your furniture. Then, compare your measurements to the size chart provided by the manufacturer. If you are not sure what size to choose, it is always better to go with a larger size.
</p>

  Here are some tips for measuring your furniture for chair covers:
</p>
<h3>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rain and snow</strong><br />

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wind</strong><br />
    <p>
      If you live in a windy climate, you will need chair covers that are wind-resistant. Wind-resistant chair covers will stay in place, even on windy days. Look for chair covers that have elastic hems or drawstrings to keep them in place.
