  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  <strong><em>Here are a few practical tips to help you achieve the best results when using Ronseal Chalky Furniture Paint on your garden furniture:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Clean and Prepare Your Furniture:</strong><br />
  Before painting, thoroughly clean your garden furniture to remove any dirt, grease, or debris. If there are any areas of peeling paint or rust, sand them down until smooth. This will ensure that the paint adheres properly and provides a long-lasting finish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Use a Primer for Better Adhesion:</strong><br />
  Although Ronseal Chalky Furniture Paint generally does not require a primer, applying a primer can be beneficial, especially on smooth or glossy surfaces. A primer helps create a better bond between the paint and the furniture, resulting in a more durable finish.

  <strong>Tip 3: Apply Thin Coats and Allow Proper Drying Time:</strong><br />
  Instead of applying one thick coat, apply two to three thin coats of Ronseal Chalky Furniture Paint. This will help prevent the paint from cracking or peeling. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Drying times may vary depending on the temperature and humidity, so be patient and allow ample time for the paint to dry properly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect Your Painted Furniture:</strong><br />
  Once you're happy with the painted finish, consider applying a protective sealant or varnish to further protect your garden furniture from the elements. This will help maintain the beauty and durability of the paint, especially if your furniture is exposed to harsh weather conditions.
