  <strong>Tip 2: Accessorize for comfort and style</strong><br />
  Add cushions, throws, and pillows to your garden furniture to enhance comfort and create a cozy atmosphere. Choose textiles that are weather-resistant and easy to clean. You can also add lanterns, candles, or string lights to create a warm and inviting ambiance in the evenings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Protect your furniture from the elements</strong><br />
  To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, protect it from the elements when not in use. Cover the furniture with waterproof covers or store it in a dry and covered location during harsh weather conditions. Regular cleaning and maintenance will also help to keep your furniture looking its best.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Repurpose your furniture for different seasons</strong><br />
  With a little creativity, you can repurpose your garden furniture to suit different seasons. For example, use your outdoor dining table as a potting bench in the spring, or turn your lounge chairs into cozy seating for a bonfire in the fall. By thinking outside the box, you can get more use out of your furniture and extend its functionality.
