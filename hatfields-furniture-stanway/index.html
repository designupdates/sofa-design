  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  If you're considering purchasing garden furniture, you may have some questions. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers to help you make an informed decision:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: The best materials for garden furniture depend on your needs and preferences. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability. Metal furniture is also durable and easy to maintain. Plastic furniture is lightweight and affordable, but it may not be as durable as other materials. Wicker and rattan furniture are stylish and comfortable, but they require more care.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How can I choose garden furniture that is comfortable?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: When choosing garden furniture, comfort is key. Look for pieces with plush cushions and supportive backs. If you plan on spending a lot of time lounging in your garden furniture, consider choosing pieces with adjustable features, such as reclining chairs or ottomans.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What size garden furniture should I choose?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: The size of your garden furniture should be proportionate to the size of your garden. If you have a small garden, choose compact pieces that won't overwhelm the space. If you have a large garden, you can choose larger pieces or even create a dedicated seating area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using covers or cushions when it's not in use. You can also apply a sealant or stain to wood furniture to help protect it from moisture and UV damage. Metal furniture can be protected with a rust-resistant coating.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How can I keep my garden furniture clean?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: To keep your garden furniture clean, wipe it down with a damp cloth and mild soap. For tougher stains, you can use a specialized furniture cleaner. Be sure to rinse the furniture thoroughly after cleaning.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Consider Your Needs and Preferences</strong><br />
  Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take some time to think about your needs and preferences. What will you be using the furniture for? How many people will be using it? What style of furniture do you prefer? Once you know what you're looking for, you can start narrowing down your options.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose Durable Materials</strong><br />
  Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to choose durable materials that can withstand rain, sun, and wind. Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal furniture is also durable, but it can be heavy and prone to rust. Plastic furniture is lightweight and affordable, but it may not be as durable as other materials.
</p>

  <strong>Tip 3: Choose Comfortable Furniture</strong><br />
  You'll be spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, so it's important to choose pieces that are comfortable. Look for chairs and sofas with plush cushions and supportive backs. If you plan on spending a lot of time lounging in your garden furniture, consider choosing pieces with adjustable features, such as reclining chairs or ottomans.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect Your Furniture from the Elements</strong><br />
