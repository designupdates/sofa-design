</p>
<p>
  There are several ways that non-skid pada can help to keep萼 level. First, they can provide a stable base for the萼. This is especially important for萼 that have a narrow base or that are top-hea.
</p>
<p>
  Second, non-skid pada can help to prevent the萼 from moving side to side. This is because they create a frictional force between the萼 and the floor. This frictional force helps to keep the萼 in place, even if it is bumped or jostled.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, non-skid pada can help to prevent the萼 from tipping forward or backward. This is because they create a downward force on the萼. This downward force helps to keep the萼 from tipping over, even if it is pushed or pulled.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, furniture non-skid pada are an effective way to help keep萼 level. They are a simple and inexpensive solution that can help to prevent accidents and damage.
</p>
<p>
