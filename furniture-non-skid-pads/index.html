  There are several ways that non-skid pada can help to keepè¼ level. First, they can provide a stable base for theè¼. This is especially important forè¼ that have a narrow base or that are top-hea.
</p>
<p>

  Finally, non-skid pada can help to prevent theè¼ from tipping forward or backward. This is because they create a downward force on theè¼. This downward force helps to keep theè¼ from tipping over, even if it is pushed or pulled.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, furniture non-skid pada are an effective way to help keepè¼ level. They are a simple and inexpensive solution that can help to prevent accidents and damage.
