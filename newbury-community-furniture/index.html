  <em>Newbury Community Furniture: Where reuse, community, and sustainability thrive!</em>
</p>
<h3>
  Furniture reuse and redistribution
</h3>
<p>
  At the heart of Newbury Community Furniture's mission lies the concept of furniture reuse and redistribution. This involves collecting unwanted furniture from the local community, upcycling and restoring it to a pristine condition, and then redistributing it to individuals and families in need at affordable prices.
</p>
<p>
  This process not only diverts thousands of items of furniture from landfills each year, reducing the environmental impact of waste, but it also provides a valuable service to those on low incomes or facing financial hardship. By offering good quality, pre-loved furniture at a fraction of the cost of new items, NCF helps create warm and comfortable homes for people who might otherwise struggle to afford essential furnishings.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, the organization's upcycling and restoration services provide opportunities for skills development and employment. Individuals facing barriers to employment can gain valuable experience in furniture repair, upholstery, and other practical skills, enhancing their employability and increasing their chances of securing permanent work.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, NCF's furniture reuse and redistribution efforts contribute to the circular economy, a model of production and consumption that aims to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization. By extending the lifespan of furniture and keeping it in circulation, NCF helps reduce the demand for new items, conserving natural resources and reducing carbon emissions associated with manufacturing and transportation.
</p>

These partnerships enable NCF to share knowledge, resources, and best practices, amplifying its impact and promoting systemic change towards a more circular and sustainable economy.

  Regular cleaning and maintenance can extend the lifespan of your garden furniture. Clean it with mild soap and water, and dry it thoroughly.
