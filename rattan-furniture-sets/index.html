    <strong>Sturdy Construction:</strong><br />

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Low Maintenance:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rattan furniture requires minimal maintenance to maintain its beauty and functionality. Regular dusting and occasional cleaning with a damp cloth are usually sufficient to keep it looking its best. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the rattan fibers.
