  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I clean and maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong>
</p>

  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I leave my garden furniture outdoors all year round?</em></strong>
</p>

  <strong>Answer:</strong> Some materials, like teak and aluminum, can withstand outdoor conditions year-round. However, it's best to store furniture indoors or use covers during harsh weather to prevent damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find high-quality garden furniture?</em></strong>
