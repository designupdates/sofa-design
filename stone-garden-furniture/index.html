</p>
<h3>
  Heavy
</h3>
<p>
  One of the things to keep in mind about stone garden furniture is that it is very heavy. This can make it difficult to move around, especially if you need to rearrange your furniture or store it away for the winter.
</p>
<p>
  If you are planning to purchase stone garden furniture, it is important to make sure that you have a plan for how you are going to move it. You may need to hire a professional mover or rent a dolly to help you transport the furniture.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have your stone garden furniture in place, it is important to be careful not to move it too often. The weight of the furniture can put stress on the joints and connections, which can lead to damage.
</p>
<p>
  If you do need to move your stone garden furniture, be sure to lift it carefully and evenly. Do not drag or slide the furniture, as this can damage the surface.
</p>

  Despite its weight, stone garden furniture is still a great choice for many people. It is durable, weather-resistant, and easy to clean. With proper care and maintenance, stone garden furniture can last for many years.
</p>
<h3>
  Weather-resistant
</h3>
<p>
  Stone garden furniture is also very weather-resistant. It can withstand rain, snow, sun, and wind without showing signs of wear and tear. This makes stone garden furniture a great choice for areas that experience extreme weather conditions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to fading</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone does not fade in the sun, so your furniture will keep its original color for many years to come.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to cracking</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone is a very strong material, so it is resistant to cracking and chipping.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to warping</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone does not warp or rot, so your furniture will not become misshapen over time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to insects</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone is not susceptible to damage from insects, so you do not have to worry about your furniture being eaten or damaged by pests.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, stone garden furniture is a great choice for anyone who is looking for durable, weather-resistant furniture that will last for many years.
</p>
<h3>
  Easy to clean
</h3>
<p>
  One of the best things about stone garden furniture is how easy it is to clean. Most stains can be removed with just soap and water. For tougher stains, you can use a mild detergent or a stone cleaner. Be sure to rinse the furniture thoroughly after cleaning to remove any soap residue.
</p>
<p>
  Stone does not require any special treatment or sealant to protect it from the elements. However, if you want to give your furniture a little extra protection, you can apply a stone sealer. Sealers help to protect the stone from stains and dirt, and they can also make the furniture easier to clean.
</p>
<p>
  To keep your stone garden furniture looking its best, be sure to clean it regularly. This will help to remove dirt and debris that can build up over time. You should also inspect your furniture regularly for any signs of damage. If you find any cracks or chips, be sure to repair them promptly to prevent further damage.

<h3>
  Expensive
</h3>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Initial cost</strong><br />
    <p>
      The initial cost of stone garden furniture can be high. However, it is important to remember that stone furniture is a long-term investment. It will last for many years, so you will not have to replace it as often as you would furniture made from other materials.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Installation cost</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone furniture can be heavy, so it may require professional installation. This can add to the overall cost of the furniture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Maintenance cost</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone furniture does not require a lot of maintenance, but it will need to be cleaned and sealed occasionally. This can add to the overall cost of the furniture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transportation cost</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone furniture can be heavy, so it can be expensive to transport. If you are planning to purchase stone furniture, be sure to factor in the cost of transportation.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Despite its cost, stone garden furniture is a great investment for many people. It is durable, weather-resistant, easy to clean, and versatile. With proper care and maintenance, stone garden furniture can last for many years.
</p>
<h3>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Uncomfortable to sit on</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone furniture can be uncomfortable to sit on, especially in the winter. The cold stone can quickly chill your body, making it difficult to relax and enjoy your time outdoors.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      Stone furniture can also be uncomfortable to lean against, especially in the winter. The cold stone can quickly chill your back and neck, making it difficult to relax and enjoy your time outdoors.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can cause health problems</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sitting on or leaning against cold stone furniture for long periods of time can lead to health problems, such as hypothermia and muscle cramps.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use cushions or blankets</strong><br />
    <p>
      To make stone furniture more comfortable to use, you can use cushions or blankets. Cushions and blankets will help to insulate your body from the cold stone, making it more comfortable to sit on or lean against.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Despite being cold to the touch, stone garden furniture is still a great choice for many people. It is durable, weather-resistant, easy to clean, and versatile. With proper care and maintenance, stone garden furniture can last for many years.
</p>
<h3>
  Can be slippery when wet
</h3>
<p>
  Stone garden furniture can be slippery when wet. This is because the smooth surface of the stone can become slippery when it is wet. This can be dangerous, especially if you are walking on or around stone furniture when it is wet.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Can cause falls</strong><br />
    <p>
      Slippery stone furniture can cause falls. If you are walking on or around stone furniture when it is wet, be sure to be careful. Wear shoes with good traction, and be sure to watch your step.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can damage the furniture</strong><br />
    <p>
      Slippery stone furniture can also be damaged if it is not properly cared for. If you are moving stone furniture when it is wet, be sure to lift it carefully. Do not drag or slide the furniture, as this can damage the surface.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use a non-slip coating</strong><br />
    <p>
      To make stone furniture less slippery, you can apply a non-slip coating. Non-slip coatings are available at most hardware stores. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying the coating.

</ul>
<p>
  Despite being slippery when wet, stone garden furniture is still a great choice for many people. It is durable, weather-resistant, easy to clean, and versatile. With proper care and maintenance, stone garden furniture can last for many years.
</p>
<h3>
  May require sealing
</h3>
<p>
  Stone garden furniture may require sealing to protect it from stains and dirt. Sealers are available at most hardware stores. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying the sealer.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Protects from stains</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sealers help to protect stone furniture from stains. Stains can be caused by a variety of things, such as food, drinks, and dirt. Sealers help to create a barrier between the stone and the stain-causing agents, making it more difficult for stains to penetrate the stone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protects from dirt</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sealers also help to protect stone furniture from dirt. Dirt can build up on stone furniture over time, making it look dull and dirty. Sealers help to create a barrier between the stone and the dirt, making it more difficult for dirt to stick to the stone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Makes cleaning easier</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sealers can also make stone furniture easier to clean. Sealed stone furniture is less likely to absorb stains and dirt, so it is easier to clean. You can simply wipe down sealed stone furniture with a damp cloth to clean it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protects from the elements</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sealers can also help to protect stone furniture from the elements. Sealers help to create a barrier between the stone and the elements, making it more resistant to damage from rain, snow, and sun.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Despite requiring sealing, stone garden furniture is still a great choice for many people. It is durable, weather-resistant, easy to clean, and versatile. With proper care and maintenance, stone garden furniture can last for many years.
