    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proper Treatment Enhances Resistance:</strong><br />
    <p>
      While pine wood naturally resists decay and insects, applying protective finishes or treatments can further enhance its resistance. Using sealants, stains, or wood preservatives specifically designed for pine can provide an additional layer of protection against moisture, decay, and insect infestation.
    </p>
