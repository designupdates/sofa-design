<h3>
  Provides vertical space for climbing and perching.
</h3>
<p>
  Cats are natural climbers and perch lovers. In the wild, they would spend their days scaling trees and surveying their surroundings from high vantage points. Wall mounted cat furniture provides your indoor cat with the opportunity to engage in these natural behaviors, even if they don't have access to the great outdoors.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vertical territory:</strong> Cats feel safe and secure when they have a vertical space to retreat to. Wall mounted cat furniture provides them with their own little kingdom where they can climb, perch, and observe their surroundings without feeling vulnerable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exercise:</strong> Climbing and perching are great forms of exercise for cats. It helps to keep them active and healthy, and can also help to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> Navigating vertical spaces and exploring different levels of cat furniture is mentally stimulating for cats. It helps to keep them engaged and entertained, and can also help to reduce stress and anxiety.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bonding:</strong> Interacting with your cat on their vertical territory can help to strengthen the bond between you. You can play with them using toys on different levels of the furniture, or simply relax and watch them explore their kingdom.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By providing your cat with vertical space for climbing and perching, you are not only meeting their natural instincts, but you are also promoting their physical and mental well-being.
</p>
<h3>
  Prevents destructive scratching of furniture.
</h3>
<p>
  Cats have a natural instinct to scratch. It helps them to mark their territory, stretch their muscles, and keep their claws healthy. However, this scratching behavior can be destructive to your furniture if you don't provide your cat with an appropriate outlet.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Protect your furniture:</strong> Wall mounted cat furniture provides your cat with a dedicated scratching surface that is designed to withstand their claws. This helps to protect your furniture from damage and saves you money in the long run.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Redirect scratching behavior:</strong> Once your cat starts using the wall mounted cat furniture to scratch, you can redirect their scratching behavior away from your furniture and onto the scratching post. This is done by placing the cat furniture near the areas where your cat usually scratches, and by making it more attractive than your furniture. You can do this by using catnip or other attractants on the scratching post.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Promote healthyçªå­care:</strong> Scratching helps to keep your cat's claws healthy and strong. By providing them with a suitable scratching surface, you are helping to maintain theirçªå­health and prevent problems such as overgrown claws.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduce stress and anxiety:</strong> Scratching is also a way for cats to relieve stress and anxiety. By providing them with a dedicated scratching post, you are helping to create a stress-free environment for your cat.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By preventing destructive scratching of furniture, you are not only protecting your belongings, but you are also helping to keep your cat happy and healthy.
</p>
<h3>
  Encourages exercise and play.
</h3>
<p>
  Cats are natural predators, and they love to chase, climb, and pounce. Wall mounted cat furniture provides them with the opportunity to engage in these natural behaviors, even if they don't have access to the great outdoors. Here are a few ways that wall mounted cat furniture encourages exercise and play:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Vertical climbing:</strong> Climbing is a great way for cats to get exercise and stay active. Wall mounted cat furniture with multiple levels and platforms allows cats to climb up and down, which helps to strengthen their muscles and improve their coordination.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perching and pouncing:</strong> Cats love to perch on high vantage points where they can survey their surroundings. Wall mounted cat furniture with perches and platforms provides them with these safe spaces, and they can also use them to pounce on toys or other cats below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Interactive play:</strong> Wall mounted cat furniture can also be used for interactive play between you and your cat. You can use toys on different levels of the furniture to engage your cat in play, or you can simply chase them up and down the cat tree. Interactive play is a great way to bond with your cat and keep them entertained.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> In addition to physical exercise, wall mounted cat furniture also provides mental stimulation for cats. Navigating vertical spaces and exploring different levels of cat furniture is mentally challenging for cats, and it helps to keep them engaged and entertained. This can help to reduce boredom and stress, and it can also help to prevent problem behaviors.
</p>
<p>
  By encouraging exercise and play, wall mounted cat furniture helps to keep cats healthy and happy. It also provides them with a fun and stimulating environment that they will love to explore.
