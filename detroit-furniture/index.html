<h3>
  Decline in the mid-20th century
</h3>
<p>
  The furniture industry in Detroit began to decline in the mid-20th century. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of foreign competition, the changing tastes of consumers, and the relocation of the city's population to the suburbs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Rise of foreign competition:</strong> After World War II, furniture makers in Japan and other countries began to export their products to the United States. This furniture was often cheaper than furniture made in the United States, and it quickly gained popularity with consumers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Changing tastes of consumers:</strong> In the mid-20th century, consumers began to move away from traditional furniture styles and towards more modern styles. This change in taste made it difficult for Detroit furniture makers to sell their products.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Relocation of the city's population to the suburbs:</strong> In the mid-20th century, many people began to move from Detroit to the suburbs. This led to a decline in demand for furniture in the city.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automation:</strong> The increasing use of automation in furniture manufacturing also contributed to the decline of the furniture industry in Detroit. Automation made it possible for furniture makers to produce furniture more efficiently, which led to a decrease in the number of jobs in the industry.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As a result of these factors, the furniture industry in Detroit declined significantly in the mid-20th century. Many furniture companies in Detroit were forced to close their doors, and thousands of people lost their jobs.
</p>
