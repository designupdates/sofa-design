  </li>
  <li>Apply a coat of primer to the furniture if desired. Primer helps the paint to adhere better to the surface of the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>Apply two coats of blue paint to the furniture, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next coat. You may need to apply more coats of paint if the color is not opaque enough.

  Durable finish
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Clean the furniture regularly with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the paint.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>If the furniture is exposed to moisture, dry it off immediately. This will help to prevent the paint from peeling or chipping.
  </li>
  <li>If the furniture is scratched or damaged, you can repair it with a touch-up paint kit.
