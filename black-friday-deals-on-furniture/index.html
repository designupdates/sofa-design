  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bring the proof to the store:</strong> When you go to the store to purchase the item, bring the proof of the lower price with you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ask for the price match:</strong> Once you're at the store, ask the customer service representative to price match the item.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Most retailers will require you to provide proof of the lower price before they will honor the price match guarantee. So be sure to have the ad or website with you when you go to the store.

</p>
<h3>
  Extended warranties
</h3>
<p>
  Many retailers offer extended warranties on their Black Friday furniture deals. This means that you can purchase an extended warranty that will cover your furniture for a longer period of time than the standard warranty.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some tips for deciding whether or not to purchase an extended warranty:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider the cost of the warranty:</strong> Extended warranties can be expensive, so be sure to factor in the cost when making your decision.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Read the terms and conditions of the warranty:</strong> Make sure you understand what the warranty covers and what the exclusions are.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider the likelihood of needing the warranty:</strong> If you're not sure whether or not you'll need the warranty, it's probably not worth the cost.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you're purchasing a high-priced furniture item, or if you're concerned about the durability of the item, then an extended warranty may be a good investment. However, if you're on a tight budget or if you're not sure whether or not you'll need the warranty, then it's probably not worth the cost.
