  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Long-lasting:</strong> Aluminium furniture is built to last. It is resistant to rust, corrosion, fading, and cracking, so you can enjoy your furniture for many years to come.

    <strong>No special cleaning products required:</strong> You don't need to use any special cleaning products or detergents to clean aluminium furniture. Simply use a mild soap and water solution and wipe it down with a damp cloth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resistant to stains and dirt:</strong> Aluminium is a non-porous material, which means that it is resistant to stains and dirt. This makes it easy to clean and maintain, even if you have spills or accidents.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Suitable for all climates:</strong> Aluminium furniture is suitable for all climates, whether you live in a humid coastal area or a cold and snowy climate. It will not rust or corrode, and it is easy to clean and maintain, regardless of the weather conditions.
