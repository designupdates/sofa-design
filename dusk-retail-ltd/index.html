</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What factors should I consider when choosing garden furniture?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> When choosing garden furniture, consider the following factors: the size and layout of your outdoor space, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, etc.), the materials used (durability and weather resistance), the style of the furniture (traditional, modern, etc.), and your budget.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Garden furniture is commonly made from a variety of materials, including wood (teak, acacia, eucalyptus), metal (wrought iron, aluminum, stainless steel), plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene), and wicker (natural or synthetic). Each material has its own unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of durability, weather resistance, maintenance, and cost.
