  Answer 2: When choosing the right size garden furniture, it is important to consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. You should also think about the activities you plan to do in your outdoor space. For example, if you plan to host large gatherings, you will need furniture that can accommodate a lot of people.
