<h3>
  Inspect carefully before buying.
</h3>
<p>
  Before you buy any piece of ex-show home furniture, it is important to inspect it carefully to make sure it is in good condition. This means looking for any signs of damage, such as scratches, dents, or stains. You should also test the furniture to make sure it is sturdy and comfortable.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Look for signs of damage.</strong><br />
    <p>
      This includes scratches, dents, stains, and tears. Be sure to inspect all of the surfaces of the furniture, including the top, bottom, sides, and back.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Test the furniture for sturdiness.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Make sure that the furniture is stable and does not wobble. You should also check to make sure that all of the joints are tight and secure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Test the furniture for comfort.</strong><br />
    <p>
      If you are buying upholstered furniture, sit on it to make sure it is comfortable. You should also check to make sure that the cushions are firm and supportive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pay attention to the hardware.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Make sure that all of the hardware, such as hinges and drawer slides, is in good working order. You should also check to make sure that all of the screws and bolts are tight.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can be sure that you are buying a piece of ex-show home furniture that is in good condition and will last for years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Look for damage and test for sturdiness.
</h3>
<p>
  When you are inspecting ex-show home furniture for damage, be sure to look for the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scratches and dents.</strong> These are the most common types of damage to ex-show home furniture. They can be caused by people bumping into the furniture or by moving it around. Scratches and dents are usually not serious, but they can detract from the appearance of the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stains.</strong> Stains can be caused by spills or by people sitting on the furniture with dirty clothes. Stains can be difficult to remove, so it is important to inspect the furniture carefully for any stains before you buy it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tears.</strong> Tears can be caused by sharp objects or by people pulling on the fabric. Tears can be repaired, but they can be expensive to fix.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loose joints.</strong> Loose joints can cause the furniture to wobble or collapse. Be sure to check all of the joints of the furniture to make sure they are tight and secure.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition to looking for damage, you should also test the furniture for sturdiness. This means making sure that the furniture is stable and does not wobble. You should also check to make sure that all of the drawers and doors open and close smoothly.
</p>
<p>
  To test the sturdiness of a piece of furniture, you can try the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Gently shake the furniture.</strong> If the furniture wobbles, it is not sturdy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sit on the furniture.</strong> If the furniture sinks or creaks, it is not sturdy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open and close the drawers and doors.</strong> If the drawers and doors do not open and close smoothly, the furniture is not sturdy.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can be sure that you are buying a piece of ex-show home furniture that is in good condition and will last for years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Negotiate price with seller.
</h3>
<p>
  Once you have found a piece of ex-show home furniture that you want to buy, it is time to negotiate a price with the seller. This can be a daunting task, but there are a few things you can do to make it easier.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do your research.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Before you start negotiating, do some research to find out what the fair market value of the furniture is. This will give you a good starting point for your negotiations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong><br />
    <p>
      If the seller is not willing to negotiate, be prepared to walk away from the deal. There are plenty of other pieces of ex-show home furniture available, so you don't have to settle for a price that you are not comfortable with.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be willing to compromise.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Negotiation is all about compromise. Be willing to meet the seller halfway, but don't be afraid to stand your ground if you think the seller is asking for too much money.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be polite and respectful.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Even if you are feeling frustrated, it is important to be polite and respectful to the seller. This will make the negotiation process more pleasant for both of you.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can increase your chances of getting a good deal on ex-show home furniture.
</p>
<h3>
  Delivery and assembly options.
</h3>
<p>
  Many furniture stores offer delivery and assembly services for ex-show home furniture. This can be a great convenience, especially if you do not have a vehicle large enough to transport the furniture yourself or if you are not comfortable assembling it yourself.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Delivery.</strong>Delivery fees vary depending on the store and the distance between the store and your home. Be sure to ask about delivery fees before you purchase the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assembly.</strong>If you purchase furniture that requires assembly, the store may offer assembly services for an additional fee. Assembly fees vary depending on the store and the difficulty of the assembly. Be sure to ask about assembly fees before you purchase the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-assembly.</strong>If you are comfortable assembling furniture yourself, you can save money by doing it yourself. Many stores offer instructions and tools to help you assemble the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Third-party delivery and assembly services.</strong>If the furniture store does not offer delivery and assembly services, you can hire a third-party company to do it for you. Third-party delivery and assembly services typically charge a flat fee for their services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By considering the delivery and assembly options available, you can make sure that your new ex-show home furniture is delivered and eivät without any hassle.
</p>
<h3>
  Returns and warranties may vary.
</h3>
<p>
  The return and warranty policies for ex-show home furniture vary depending on the store where you purchase it. Some stores may offer a full refund or exchange if you are not satisfied with the furniture, while others may only offer a store credit or a repair. Some stores may also offer a warranty on the furniture, while others may not.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to ask about the return and warranty policies before you purchase ex-show home furniture. This will help you to avoid any surprises if you need to return or repair the furniture.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some things to keep in mind when considering the return and warranty policies for ex-show home furniture:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Read the return policy carefully.</strong> Make sure you understand the terms of the return policy, including the time frame for returns and the conditions under which returns are accepted.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ask about the warranty.</strong> Find out if the furniture comes with a warranty and, if so, what the terms of the warranty are.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Keep your receipts.</strong> Be sure to keep all of your receipts related to the purchase of your furniture. You will need these receipts if you need to return or repair the furniture.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can protect yourself if you need to return or repair your ex-show home furniture.
