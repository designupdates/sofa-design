</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and weather resistance.
