  Once you've chosen your furniture, it's time to arrange it in a way that creates a cohesive look and feel. Start by placing your largest pieces of furniture, such as your sofa or dining table, in the center of your space. Then, add smaller pieces, such as chairs, benches, and side tables, around the larger pieces. Be sure to leave enough space between pieces of furniture so that people can move around comfortably.

<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Add cushions and pillows for comfort</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Cushions and pillows can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. Choose cushions and pillows that are made from weather-resistant materials and that match the style of your furniture. You can also add a throw blanket for extra warmth on cooler evenings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, it's important to protect it from the elements. Cover your furniture when it's not in use and store it in a dry place during the off-season. You can also apply a sealant to your furniture to help protect it from the sun and rain.
