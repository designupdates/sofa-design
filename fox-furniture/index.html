<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right materials:</strong> Consider the climate in your area and the intended use of your furniture. For example, if you live in a rainy climate, teak or aluminum are good choices as they are naturally water-resistant. If you have children or pets, opt for durable materials like wicker or textilene that can withstand spills and stains.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Measure your space:</strong> Before purchasing garden furniture, carefully measure your outdoor space to ensure that the pieces you choose will fit comfortably. Consider the size of your patio, deck, or lawn, and allow for enough space to move around and entertain guests.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider comfort and style:</strong> Garden furniture should be both comfortable and stylish. Choose pieces that provide adequate support and cushioning, and that complement your existing outdoor decor. Pay attention to the height and depth of seats, as well as the overall design and color scheme.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture:</strong> To prolong the lifespan of your garden furniture, protect it from the elements when not in use. Cover it with weather-resistant covers or store it in a dry place during harsh weather conditions. Regularly clean your furniture with mild soap and water, and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.
