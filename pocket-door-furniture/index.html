  Pocket door furniture encompasses the various hardware components used in the construction and operation of pocket doors, which are doors that slide horizontally into a wall cavity when opened, creating a space-saving and aesthetically pleasing solution in homes and commercial buildings alike.
</p>
<p>
  Pocket door hardware typically includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Door hangers:</b> Responsible for suspending the door from the track.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Track:</b> A metal or plastic rail that provides a smooth surface for the door to roll on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Stops:</b> Prevent the door from overextending or falling out of the track.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Guides:</b> Ensure the door remains vertical as it slides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pulls and handles:</b> Allow users to open and close the door.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The selection and installation of pocket door furniture play a crucial role in the functionality, durability, and overall aesthetic of the door. Choosing high-quality components that are compatible with the door weight, size, and desired level of smoothness is essential for a successful installation.

<p>
  ドアの開閉のスムーズさや耐久性に大きく関与するため、ドアの重量やサイズ、使用頻度などを踏まえて適切なものを選ぶことが大切です。
</p>
<h3>
  Track
</h3>
<p>
  The track is a metal or plastic rail that provides a smooth surface for the door hangers to roll on. It is typically installed inside the wall cavity and can be either exposed or concealed. The track's length and weight capacity should be selected based on the size and weight of the door.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some additional details about the track:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Material:</strong> Tracks can be made from various materials, including steel, aluminum, and plastic. Steel tracks are strong and durable, but they can be noisy. Aluminum tracks are lightweight and corrosion-resistant, but they may not be as strong as steel tracks. Plastic tracks are the quietest option, but they are not as durable as steel or aluminum tracks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shape:</strong> Tracks can be either straight or curved. Curved tracks are ideal for applications where the door needs to follow a curved path, such as in a circular room or around a corner.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Finish:</strong> Tracks can be coated with a variety of finishes, including paint, powder coating, or anodizing. The finish can help protect the track from corrosion and wear and can also match the décor of the room.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Choosing the right track is essential for the smooth and reliable operation of a pocket door. Factors to consider when selecting a track include the weight and size of the door, the desired level of noise reduction, and the aesthetics of the room.
</p>
<h3>
  Stops
</h3>
<p>
  Stops are small, unobtrusive components that prevent the pocket door from overextending or falling out of the track when it is opened or closed. They are typically installed at the ends of the track and can be adjusted to accommodate different door sizes and weights.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Types of stops</strong><br />
    <p>
      There are two main types of stops: fixed stops and adjustable stops. Fixed stops are permanently attached to the track and cannot be moved, while adjustable stops can be moved to adjust the door's travel distance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Materials</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stops can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and rubber. Plastic stops are the most common type, as they are durable, inexpensive, and easy to install. Metal stops are more durable than plastic stops, but they can be more expensive and difficult to install. Rubber stops are the quietest type of stop, but they are not as durable as plastic or metal stops.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjustability</strong><br />
    <p>
      Adjustable stops allow you to fine-tune the door's travel distance, ensuring that it opens and closes smoothly and securely. This is especially important for doors that are heavy or large.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Installation</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stops are typically installed by screwing them into the track. It is important to install the stops correctly to ensure that the door operates properly and safely.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Stops are an essential component of any pocket door system, as they help to prevent damage to the door and the track. When choosing stops, it is important to consider the weight and size of the door, as well as the desired level of noise reduction.
</p>
<h3>
  Guides
</h3>
<p>
  Guides are used to keep the pocket door in a vertical position as it slides along the track. They are typically made of metal or plastic and are attached to the top and bottom of the door. Guides help to prevent the door from sagging or tilting, which can cause it to bind or jam. In some cases, guides may also be used to reduce noise and vibration when the door is opened or closed.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some additional details about guides:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Types of guides</strong><br />
    <p>
      There are two main types of guides: top guides and bottom guides. Top guides are attached to the top of the door and run along the top of the track. Bottom guides are attached to the bottom of the door and run along the bottom of the track. Some pocket door systems may use both top and bottom guides, while others may only use one type of guide.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Materials</strong><br />
    <p>
      Guides can be made from a variety of materials, including steel, aluminum, and plastic. Steel guides are the most durable, but they can be noisy. Aluminum guides are lightweight and corrosion-resistant, but they may not be as strong as steel guides. Plastic guides are the quietest option, but they are not as durable as steel or aluminum guides.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjustability</strong><br />
    <p>
      Some guides are adjustable, which allows you to fine-tune the door's alignment and ensure that it operates smoothly and quietly. Adjustable guides can be especially helpful for doors that are heavy or large.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Installation</strong><br />
    <p>
      Guides are typically installed by screwing them into the door. It is important to install the guides correctly to ensure that the door operates properly and safely.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Guides are an essential component of any pocket door system, as they help to keep the door in a vertical position and prevent it from binding or jamming. When choosing guides, it is important to consider the weight and size of the door, as well as the desired level of noise reduction.
</p>
<h3>
  Pulls and handles
</h3>
<p>
  Pulls and handles are used to open and close the pocket door. They are typically attached to the face of the door and can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and glass. Pulls and handles come in a wide range of styles to complement any décor.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some additional details about pulls and handles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Types of pulls and handles</strong><br />
    <p>
      There are two main types of pulls and handles: recessed pulls and surface-mounted pulls. Recessed pulls are inset into the door, while surface-mounted pulls are attached to the surface of the door. Recessed pulls are less obtrusive than surface-mounted pulls, but they can be more difficult to install.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Materials</strong><br />
    <p>
      Pulls and handles can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and glass. Wood pulls and handles are warm and inviting, but they can be more expensive than other materials. Metal pulls and handles are durable and easy to clean, but they can be cold and uninviting. Plastic pulls and handles are lightweight and inexpensive, but they may not be as durable as other materials. Glass pulls and handles are elegant and stylish, but they can be more fragile than other materials.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Styles</strong><br />
    <p>
      Pulls and handles come in a wide range of styles to complement any décor. Some popular styles include contemporary, traditional, and rustic. Contemporary pulls and handles are typically simple and understated, while traditional pulls and handles are more ornate. Rustic pulls and handles are often made from natural materials, such as wood or stone.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Installation</strong><br />
    <p>
      Pulls and handles are typically installed by screwing them into the door. It is important to install the pulls and handles correctly to ensure that they are secure and easy to use.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Pulls and handles are an important part of any pocket door system, as they allow you to open and close the door easily and safely. When choosing pulls and handles, it is important to consider the style of the door and the décor of the room.
</p>
<h3>
