<h3>
  Durable and weather-resistant.
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing an 8 seat rattan garden furniture set, durability and weather-resistance are key factors to consider. Rattan, a naturally resilient material, is known for its ability to withstand the elements. It can endure rain, sun exposure, and humidity without deteriorating, making it an ideal choice for outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  Synthetic rattan, also known as poly rattan or PE rattan, is another popular option for garden furniture. It is specifically designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. Unlike natural rattan, synthetic rattan is resistant to fading, cracking, and insect damage. It also requires minimal maintenance, making it a practical choice for busy individuals or those who want to spend less time on upkeep.
</p>
<p>
  Many 8 seat rattan garden furniture sets are constructed with sturdy frames made of aluminum or steel. These frames are rust-resistant and can withstand strong winds and heavy use. Aluminum frames are particularly lightweight, making them easy to move around. Steel frames, on the other hand, are more durable and can support heavier loads.
</p>
<p>
  The cushions and upholstery used in rattan garden furniture sets are also designed to withstand outdoor conditions. They are typically made from water-resistant and UV-resistant materials, ensuring they can handle rain and sun exposure without fading or deteriorating. Some sets even come with removable and machine-washable cushions for easy cleaning.
</p>
<p>
  By choosing an 8 seat rattan garden furniture set that is durable and weather-resistant, you can be sure that it will last for years to come, providing you with a comfortable and stylish outdoor space to enjoy with friends and family.
