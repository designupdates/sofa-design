  <strong>Essential Points:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean thoroughly
  </li>
  <li>Sand and de-nib
  </li>
  <li>Use primer
  </li>
  <li>Apply thin coats
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>Protect with wax or varnish
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you'll achieve a professional-looking finish that will last for years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Clean thoroughly
</h3>
<p>
  The first step to painting furniture with Farrow &amp; Ball paint is to clean it thoroughly. This will remove any dirt, dust, or grease that could prevent the paint from adhering properly. Use a mild detergent and warm water to clean the furniture, and be sure to rinse it well afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  Once the furniture is clean, you need to de-grease it. This will help to ensure that the paint will adhere properly and will not peel or chip over time. To de-grease the furniture, use a mixture of one part white spirit to one part water. Apply the mixture to the furniture with a clean cloth, and then allow it to dry completely.
</p>
<p>
  Once the furniture is clean and de-greased, you can start painting. Be sure to apply thin, even strokes, and allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next. Once you have applied two or three thin layers of paint, you will have a beautiful, new finish on your furniture.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some tips for cleaning furniture before painting:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a mild detergent and warm water.
  </li>
  <li>Rinse the furniture well afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>De-grease the furniture with a mixture of one part white spirit to one part water.
  </li>
  <li>Allow the furniture to dry completely before painting.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Sand and de-nib
</h3>
<p>
  Once you have cleaned the furniture, you need to sand and de-nib it. This will help to create a smooth surface for the paint to adhere to, and will also help to remove any imperfections in the wood.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sanding</strong><br />
    <p>
      To sand the furniture, use a fine-grit sandpaper (120-grit or higher). Sand in the direction of the wood grain, and be sure to sand all of the surfaces of the furniture, including the legs, arms, and back.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>De-nibbing</strong><br />
    <p>
      Once you have sanded the furniture, you need to de-nib it. De-nibbing is the process of removing any raised grain from the wood. To de-nib the furniture, use a sanding sponge or a fine-grit sandpaper (220-grit or higher). Sand lightly in the direction of the wood grain, and be careful not to sand too much, as this could damage the wood.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have sanded and de-nibbed the furniture, it is ready to be painted.
</p>### Use primer Primer is an essential step when painting furniture with Farrow &amp; Ball paint. It helps to create a smooth, even surface for the paint to adhere to, and it also helps to prevent the paint from peeling or chipping over time. There are two types of primer that can be used with Farrow &amp; Ball paint: * **Oil-based primer:** Oil-based primer is the traditional choice for priming furniture. It is very durable and provides excellent adhesion. However, oil-based primer can be difficult to apply and it has a strong odor. * **Water-based primer:** Water-based primer is a newer option that is easier to apply and has a milder odor than oil-based primer. However, water-based primer is not as durable as oil-based primer. For most furniture painting projects, water-based primer is a good choice. It is easy to apply and it provides good adhesion. To apply primer, use a brush or roller to apply a thin, even coat to all of the surfaces of the furniture. Be sure to allow the primer to dry completely before painting. Here are some tips for using primer when painting furniture: * Use a brush or roller to apply primer, and be sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. * Apply a thin, even coat of primer to all of the surfaces of the furniture. * Allow the primer to dry completely before painting.
<h3>
  Apply thin coats
</h3>When painting furniture with Farrow &amp; Ball paint, it is important to apply thin coats. This will help to prevent the paint from running or dripping, and it will also help to create a smooth, even finish. Here are some tips for applying thin coats of paint: * Use a brush or roller to apply the paint, and be sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. * Apply a thin, even coat of paint to all of the surfaces of the furniture. * Allow the paint to dry completely before applying the next coat. It is better to apply several thin coats of paint than one thick coat. Thick coats of paint are more likely to run or drip, and they can also be more difficult to smooth out. ### Sand between coats Once you have applied the first coat of paint, it is important to sand it lightly before applying the next coat. This will help to smooth out any brush strokes or imperfections in the paint, and it will also help to create a stronger bond between the coats of paint. To sand between coats, use a fine-grit sandpaper (220-grit or higher). Sand lightly in the direction of the wood grain, and be careful not to sand too much, as this could damage the paint. Once you have sanded the first coat of paint, you can apply the second coat. Be sure to apply a thin, even coat of paint, and allow it to dry completely before sanding it. You may need to sand between coats several times, depending on the condition of the furniture and the type of paint you are using. However, sanding between coats is an important step that will help to ensure a smooth, even finish. ### Protect with wax or varnish Once you have finished painting your furniture with Farrow &amp; Ball paint, it is important to protect the finish with wax or varnish. This will help to protect the paint from scratches, stains, and wear and tear. There are two types of finishes that can be used with Farrow &amp; Ball paint: * **Wax:** Wax is a traditional finish that gives furniture a soft, matte sheen. Wax is easy to apply and it can be buffed to achieve the desired sheen. However, wax does not provide as much protection as varnish. * **Varnish:** Varnish is a more durable finish that gives furniture a hard, glossy sheen. Varnish is more difficult to apply than wax, but it provides better protection against scratches and stains. For most furniture painting projects, varnish is the best choice. It provides good protection and it is relatively easy to apply. To apply varnish, use a brush or roller to apply a thin, even coat to all of the surfaces of the furniture. Be sure to allow the varnish to dry completely before using the furniture. Here are some tips for protecting your painted furniture with wax or varnish: * Apply wax or varnish to all of the surfaces of the furniture, including the top, sides, bottom, and back. * Allow the wax or varnish to dry completely before using the furniture. * Reapply wax or varnish every few months to keep the finish looking its best.
