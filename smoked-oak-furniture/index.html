</p>
<p>
  The smoking process enhances the natural durability of oak wood, making it more resistant to scratches, dents, and other signs of wear and tear. This durability is attributed to the chemical changes that occur during the smoking process, which result in a denser and harder wood structure.

<p>
  The resistance to wear is particularly advantageous in areas such as dining tables, coffee tables, and other furniture pieces that experience frequent use. Smoked oak furniture can withstand the rigors of everyday life, including accidental bumps, spills, and scratches, without showing signs of damage.
</p>
<p>
