</p>
<p>
  Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take some time to think about your needs and preferences. What do you plan on using the furniture for?

  When choosing garden furniture, it's important to consider the style of your garden. If you have a traditional garden, you might want to choose classic furniture made from wood or metal. If you have a modern garden, you might want to choose more contemporary furniture made from plastic or wicker.
</p>
<p>
