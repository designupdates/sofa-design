  </li>
  <li>Place your furniture in a spot that offers a nice view and is protected from strong winds.

  <strong>Tip 2: Arrange your furniture for functionality and comfort:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Create conversation areas by arranging seating in a circle or U-shape.

  <li>Leave enough space between furniture pieces to allow for easy movement.
  </li>
  <li>Place side tables or ottomans near seating areas for drinks and snacks.
  </li>
  <li>Add a rug to define the space and add warmth.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Accessorize with cushions, throws, and pillows:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose cushions and throws in weather-resistant fabrics that can withstand the elements.
  </li>
  <li>Mix and match patterns and colors to create a personal and inviting look.
  </li>
  <li>Add pillows for extra comfort and support.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean your furniture regularly with a mild detergent and water.
  </li>
  <li>For wooden furniture, apply a sealant or oil to protect it from the elements.
  </li>
  <li>Metal furniture can be protected with a rust-resistant coating.
  </li>
  <li>Plastic furniture is generally low-maintenance, but it should be kept clean to prevent fading and cracking.
  </li>
</ul>
