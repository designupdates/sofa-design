</h3>

</p>
<p>
  Beeswax is resistant to scratches because it is a hard finish. It is also resistant to heat because it has a high melting point. This means that it will not soften or melt even in hot environments.
</p>
<p>
  Beeswax is also water-resistant. This means that it can repel water and moisture. This makes it a great choice for furniture that is used outdoors or in humid environments.
</p>
