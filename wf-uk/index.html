Some popular materials for garden furniture include wood, metal, plastic, and wicker.

If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose classic garden furniture made from wood or metal. If you have a modern home, you may want to choose more contemporary furniture made from plastic or wicker.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Care for your garden furniture regularly.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come, it's important to care for it regularly. This includes cleaning the furniture, protecting it from the elements, and storing it properly when it's not in use.
