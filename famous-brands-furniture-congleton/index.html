  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to our comprehensive FAQ section dedicated to garden furniture. Here, we aim to provide answers to some of the most common questions our customers have. Whether you're just starting to explore your options or are ready to make a purchase, we're here to guide you every step of the way.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best suited for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The choice of materials for garden furniture depends on your specific needs and preferences. Teak, acacia, and eucalyptus are popular choices for their durability and resistance to rot and decay. Wicker and rattan offer a more traditional and cozy look, while aluminum and stainless steel provide a modern and sleek aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, regular cleaning and maintenance are essential. Use a mild soap solution to clean dirt and debris, and apply a protective sealant or oil to prevent fading and water damage. When not in use, consider covering your furniture with waterproof covers or storing it indoors.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What size and style of garden furniture is right for my space?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Before purchasing garden furniture, it's important to measure your available space and consider the overall style of your outdoor area. Choose pieces that are proportionate to the size of your space and complement the existing décor. If you have a small balcony or patio, opt for compact and foldable furniture. For larger gardens, you may want to consider a combination of seating, dining, and lounge pieces.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I create a comfortable and inviting outdoor living area?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To create a comfortable and inviting outdoor living area, start by defining different zones for seating, dining, and relaxation. Choose comfortable and weather-resistant cushions and throws for your seating areas. Add ambient lighting with lanterns or fairy lights, and incorporate plants and greenery to bring a touch of nature into your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How often should I clean my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The frequency of cleaning your garden furniture depends on how often it's used and the materials it's made from. As a general rule, it's a good idea to clean your furniture at least once a month during the summer months and less frequently during the winter.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The durability of your garden furniture will depend on the materials it's made from and the climate you live in. While some materials, such as teak and aluminum, can withstand year-round exposure to the elements, others may require additional protection during harsh weather conditions. If possible, store your furniture indoors or under a protective cover during extreme weather.

  <strong>Tip 1: Accessorize for comfort</strong><br />
  Add comfortable cushions and throws to your seating areas to enhance their comfort and style. Choose weather-resistant fabrics that can withstand the elements and are easy to clean. Consider adding an outdoor rug to define your space and create a cozy atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Create shade and shelter</strong><br />
  Protect yourself from the sun and rain by incorporating shade into your outdoor living area. Use a parasol, awning, or shade sail to create a shaded spot for relaxation. You can also plant trees or climbing vines around your seating areas to provide natural shade and privacy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Light up your evenings</strong><br />
  Extend your enjoyment of your garden furniture into the evening hours by adding ambient lighting. String lights, lanterns, or candles can create a magical atmosphere and make your outdoor space more inviting after dark. Consider using solar-powered lights for a sustainable and energy-efficient option.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your furniture regularly</strong><br />
  Regular cleaning and maintenance will help extend the lifespan of your garden furniture. Wipe down your furniture with a mild soap solution and apply a protective sealant or oil as needed. Store cushions and throws indoors or under a cover when not in use to protect them from the elements.
