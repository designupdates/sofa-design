</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />

  When placing your garden furniture, consider the amount of sunlight and shade in the area. You may want to place your furniture under a tree or umbrella to provide shade on hot days.

  <strong><em>Tip 3: Add cushions and pillows for comfort.</em></strong><br />
  Cushions and pillows can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. Choose cushions and pillows that are made from weather-resistant fabrics and that complement the style of your furniture. You can also add throws and blankets to keep warm on cooler evenings.
</p>
<p>
