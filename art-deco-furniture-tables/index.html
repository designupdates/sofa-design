      For example, a table with a marquetry top made of different types of wood would be a great choice for a traditional or formal home. A table with a marquetry top made of different colors of metal would be a great choice for a modern or contemporary home.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Metalwork</strong>: Metalwork is another common decorative element found on Art Deco furniture tables. Metalwork can be used to create a variety of different designs, from simple geometric patterns to more elaborate scenes.<br />
    <p>
      For example, a table with a metal base with geometric designs would be a great choice for a modern or contemporary home. A table with a metal base with more elaborate scenes would be a great choice for a traditional or formal home.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Other decorative elements</strong>: In addition to carvings, marquetry, and metalwork, Art Deco furniture tables can also be decorated with a variety of other elements, such as inlays, moldings, and veneers. These elements can be used to create a variety of different looks, from simple and understated to more elaborate and ornate.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing an Art Deco furniture table that is decorated with carvings, marquetry, or metalwork, it is important to consider the overall style of your home and the desired effect you want to create. If you want to create a sense of opulence and drama, choose a table with elaborate carvings and metalwork. If you want to create a more modern or contemporary look, choose a table with simpler carvings and metalwork, or with no decorative elements at all.
