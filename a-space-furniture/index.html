  <strong>2. Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wood is durable and beautiful, but it requires more maintenance than other materials. Metal is strong and durable, but it can be hot to the touch in the sun. Plastic is lightweight and easy to clean, but it can be less durable than other materials. Wicker is a natural material that is both durable and stylish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Consider the size of your garden.</strong> You don't want to overcrowd your garden with furniture. Make sure to measure your garden before you start shopping for furniture. You should also consider the size of your family and the number of guests you typically entertain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Choose comfortable furniture.</strong> You're going to be spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, so make sure it's comfortable. Look for furniture with cushions or pillows. You may also want to add a throw blanket for extra warmth on cooler evenings.
</p>
