  Ercol furniture from the 1960s is known for its use of natural materials, such as wood, leather, and cane.

<h3>
  Steam-bending techniques
</h3>
<p>
  Ercol was a pioneer in the use of steam-bending techniques to create furniture. Steam-bending is a process that uses steam to soften wood, making it more pliable and easier to bend. This allows furniture makers to create curved and shaped pieces of furniture that would not be possible using traditional woodworking techniques.
</p>
<p>
  Ercol used steam-bending techniques to create a variety of furniture pieces, including chairs, tables, and cabinets. Some of his most iconic pieces, such as the Butterfly chair and the Windsor chair, feature steam-bent wood. Steam-bending also allowed Ercol to create furniture that was both strong and lightweight.
</p>
<p>
  The process of steam-bending wood is complex and requires specialized equipment. First, the wood is steamed in aå°ç¨ã®çª¯ (specialized kiln) until it becomes pliable. Once the wood is pliable, it is placed in a mold and bent into the desired shape. The wood is then left to cool and dry in the mold. Once the wood is dry, it is removed from the mold and sanded and finished.
</p>
<p>
  Steam-bending techniques allowed Ercol to create furniture that was both beautiful and functional. His steam-bent furniture is still popular today, and it can be found in homes and offices around the world.
</p>
<p>
  Ercol's use of steam-bending techniques was a groundbreaking innovation in furniture making. It allowed him to create furniture that was both stylish and functional. His steam-bent furniture is still popular today, and it is considered to be a classic of mid-century modern design.
