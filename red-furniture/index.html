<h3>
  Maintenance: Red furniture may require more maintenance than furniture in other colors.
</h3>

  Red furniture may require more maintenance than furniture in other colors. This is because red is a more delicate color and is more prone to fading and staining. Here are a few tips for maintaining red furniture:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clean regularly:</strong> Red furniture should be cleaned regularly with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or detergents, as these can damage the fabric.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protect from sunlight:</strong> Red furniture should be protected from direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause the fabric to fade and become brittle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid spills:</strong> Spills should be cleaned up immediately. Spills can stain red fabric, so it is important to act quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
