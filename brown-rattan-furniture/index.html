  <strong><em>Have questions about garden furniture? Here are some commonly asked questions and their answers:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: The best material for garden furniture depends on your specific needs and preferences. Popular options include wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood offers a classic and natural look, but requires regular maintenance. Metal is durable and weather-resistant, but can be heavy and prone to rust.

  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose comfortable garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: When choosing comfortable garden furniture, consider the following factors: seat depth, seat height, back support, and cushions.

Cushions can add extra comfort and personalization to your furniture.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: What are some space-saving garden furniture options?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: If you have a small garden or patio, consider choosing space-saving garden furniture options such as foldable or stackable chairs, benches with built-in storage, and hanging chairs. These options can help you maximize your space and create a functional and stylish outdoor area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
