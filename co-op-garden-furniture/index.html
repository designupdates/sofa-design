These certifications, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), provide assurance that the wood is harvested from well-managed forests and that the rights of workers and indigenous communities are respected.
</p>
<p>
  By using ethically sourced wood, co-op garden furniture helps to protect forests and promote sustainable forestry practices. This ensures that future generations can also enjoy the beauty and benefits of wood furniture while preserving the natural ecosystems that these forests support.
