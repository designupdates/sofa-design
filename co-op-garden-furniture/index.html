<p>
  A wide variety of recycled materials are used in co-op garden furniture, including:
</p>
<ul>

    <strong>Wood:</strong> Scrap wood from construction sites and furniture workshops is repurposed to create co-op garden furniture. This not only reduces waste but also ensures that the wood is sustainably sourced.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Metal:</strong> Discarded metal objects, such as old car parts and appliances, are transformed into furniture frames, legs, and other structural elements. This process not only diverts metal from landfills but also gives these discarded items a new purpose.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fabric:</strong> Recycled fabrics, such as old clothes, curtains, and upholstery, are used to create cushions, pillows, and other soft furnishings for co-op garden furniture. This not only reduces textile waste but also adds a unique and personal touch to the furniture.

<h3>
  Ethically sourced wood
</h3>
<p>
  Co-op garden furniture takes ethical sourcing of wood seriously. This means ensuring that the wood used in the furniture comes from sustainably managed forests and that workers involved in the harvesting and production process are treated fairly and paid a living wage.
</p>
<p>
  Co-op garden furniture makers often work with certified wood suppliers who adhere to strict environmental and social standards. These certifications, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), provide assurance that the wood is harvested from well-managed forests and that the rights of workers and indigenous communities are respected.
</p>
<p>
  By using ethically sourced wood, co-op garden furniture helps to protect forests and promote sustainable forestry practices. This ensures that future generations can also enjoy the beauty and benefits of wood furniture while preserving the natural ecosystems that these forests support.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to environmental and social concerns, co-op garden furniture makers also consider the aesthetic qualities of the wood they use. They carefully select wood species that are known for their durability, beauty, and unique characteristics. This results in furniture pieces that are not only sustainable but also visually stunning and long-lasting.
</p>
<p>
  The use of ethically sourced wood in co-op garden furniture is a testament to the commitment of these makers to sustainability and social responsibility. By choosing co-op garden furniture, consumers can support ethical forestry practices and enjoy the beauty of wood furniture with a clear conscience.
