  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are some practical tips to help you get the most out of Cuprinol Ultimate Furniture Oil for your garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Clean your furniture thoroughly before applying the oil.</strong><br />
  Dirt and debris can prevent the oil from penetrating the wood properly, reducing its effectiveness. Use a mild detergent and warm water to clean your furniture, then allow it to dry completely before applying the oil.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Apply the oil in thin, even coats.</strong><br />
  Applying too much oil can make the furniture look greasy and attract dirt. Instead, apply thin, even coats and allow each coat to penetrate the wood before applying the next. This will ensure that the oil is absorbed properly and provides maximum protection.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Reapply the oil regularly.</strong><br />
  For optimal protection, reapply Cuprinol Ultimate Furniture Oil to your garden furniture every 6 to 12 months, or more frequently if the furniture is exposed to harsh weather conditions. Reapplying the oil will help to maintain the furniture's appearance and protect it from damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Store the oil in a cool, dry place.</strong><br />
  Cuprinol Ultimate Furniture Oil should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. This will help to preserve the quality of the oil and extend its shelf life.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can ensure that your garden furniture is well-protected and looking its best for years to come.
