  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scandinavian Simplicity:</strong> Scandinavian wood sofas are known for their simplicity and functionality. They often feature light-colored woods and soft, comfortable cushions.

  <li>
    <strong>Wood sofas are adjustable.</strong> Many wood sofas have adjustable cushions and backs. This allows you to customize the sofa to your own personal comfort level.
