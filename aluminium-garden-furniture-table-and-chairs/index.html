<h3>
  Lightweight

<p>
  One of the biggest advantages of aluminium garden furniture is its light weight. This makes it easy to move around, even for smaller people. You can easily rearrange your furniture to create a new look, or move it out of the way when you need to mow the lawn or do other yard work.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Overall, the lightweight nature of aluminium garden furniture makes it a great choice for people of all ages and abilities.
</p>
<h3>
  Rust-resistant
</h3>
<p>
  Another big advantage of aluminium garden furniture is its rust-resistance. Unlike iron or steel furniture, aluminium will not rust when exposed to moisture. This makes it a great choice for outdoor use, as it can withstand the elements without deteriorating.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No need to worry about rust stains</strong><br />
    <p>
      If you have ever had iron or steel furniture, you know that it can rust easily, especially in humid environments. Rust stains are not only unsightly, but they can also be difficult to remove. With aluminium furniture, you don't have to worry about rust stains, as the material is naturally resistant to rust.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Long-lasting</strong><br />
    <p>
      Because aluminium furniture is rust-resistant, it will last longer than iron or steel furniture. You can enjoy your aluminium furniture for many years to come, without having to worry about it rusting and deteriorating.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy to clean</strong><br />
    <p>
      Rust can be difficult to remove, but aluminium furniture is easy to clean. You can simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No need to paint or seal</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unlike iron or steel furniture, aluminium furniture does not need to be painted or sealed to protect it from rust. This can save you time and money in the long run.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the rust-resistance of aluminium garden furniture makes it a great choice for people who want furniture that will last for many years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Weather-resistant
</h3>
<p>
  Aluminium garden furniture is also weather-resistant, meaning that it can withstand the elements without deteriorating. This makes it a great choice for outdoor use, as it can be left outside all year round without rusting or fading.
</p>

    <strong>Can withstand the sun's UV rays</strong><br />
    <p>
      The sun's UV rays can damage furniture over time, causing it to fade or become brittle. Aluminium furniture is resistant to UV rays, so it will not fade or become brittle even after prolonged exposure to the sun.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can withstand rain, snow, and ice</strong><br />
    <p>
      Aluminium furniture is also resistant to rain, snow, and ice. It will not rust or corrode, even if it is exposed to these elements for long periods of time.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Can withstand extreme temperatures</strong><br />
    <p>
      Aluminium furniture can withstand extreme temperatures, from hot to cold. It will not warp or crack, even if it is exposed to very high or very low temperatures.

    <p>
      Because aluminium furniture is weather-resistant, it requires very little maintenance. You can simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
