<p>
  <strong>Natural Rattan:</strong> Natural rattan is a sturdy and resilient material, able to withstand the elements without losing its structural integrity. It is resistant to moisture, UV rays, and extreme temperatures, ensuring longevity in outdoor conditions.

<p>
  <strong>Powder-Coated Frames:</strong> The frames of rattan bistro furniture are typically made of powder-coated steel or aluminum, providing excellent resistance to rust and corrosion. This ensures that the furniture remains sturdy and stable even in harsh weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Easy Maintenance:</strong> Rattan bistro furniture requires minimal maintenance to keep it looking its best. Regular cleaning with a damp cloth and mild soap solution is sufficient to remove dirt and debris. For synthetic rattan, you can even use a hose to rinse away dirt.
