  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong><br />
  To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come, it's important to maintain it regularly. Clean your furniture according to the manufacturer's instructions, and apply protective sealants or oils to wooden furniture as needed. Store your furniture indoors or use covers during harsh weather conditions to protect it from the elements.
