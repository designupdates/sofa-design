  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are four tips for choosing and caring for garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, wood is durable and beautiful, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal is strong and weather-resistant, but it can get hot in the sun. Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but it can be less durable than other materials. Wicker is a natural material that is both stylish and comfortable, but it can be more expensive than other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Consider your climate.</strong> If you live in a climate with extreme weather conditions, you'll need to choose garden furniture that is made from a durable material that can withstand the elements. For example, if you live in a hot and humid climate, you'll want to choose furniture made from a material that is resistant to fading and mildew. If you live in a cold climate, you'll want to choose furniture made from a material that is resistant to rust and frost.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Measure your space.</strong> Before you buy garden furniture, it's important to measure the space where you plan to put it. This will help you choose furniture that is the right size and scale for your space. You don't want to buy furniture that is too big or too small for your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Clean and maintain your furniture regularly.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best, it's important to clean and maintain it regularly. The best way to clean your furniture will depend on the material it is made from. For example, wood furniture should be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution. Metal furniture can be cleaned with a mild detergent and water solution. Plastic furniture can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution or a commercial plastic cleaner.
