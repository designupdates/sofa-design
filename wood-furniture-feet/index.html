<h3>
  Protect floors, reduce noise.
</h3>
<p>
  Wood furniture feet can play a significant role in protecting your floors and reducing noise caused by moving furniture. Here's how:
</p><b>Protect floors:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Scratches and dents:</b> Furniture feet create a buffer between the furniture legs and the floor, preventing scratches, dents, and gouges caused by dragging or moving furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scuff marks:</b> By raising the furniture slightly off the floor, furniture feet help prevent scuff marks that can be caused by the constant rubbing of furniture legs against the floor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Carpet damage:</b> For furniture placed on carpets, furniture feet can help prevent the carpet from being crushed or flattened over time.
  </li>
</ul><b>Reduce noise:</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Impact noise:</b> When furniture is moved, the impact of the legs hitting the floor can create a loud noise. Furniture feet, especially those made from soft materials like felt or rubber, can absorb some of this impact, reducing the noise level.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sliding noise:</b> Furniture feet can also help reduce the noise caused by sliding furniture across the floor. This is particularly helpful for furniture that is frequently moved, such as chairs or dining tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Squeaking noise:</b> Sometimes, furniture can develop a squeaking noise when it is moved. This is often caused by friction between the furniture legs and the floor. Furniture feet can help eliminate this noise by providing a smooth surface for the furniture to move on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By protecting your floors and reducing noise, wood furniture feet can make your home a more comfortable and enjoyable place to live. When choosing furniture feet, consider the type of flooring you have and the amount of noise you want to reduce.

  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and answers to help you make informed decisions and enjoy your outdoor space to the fullest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  <b>Answer:</b> Garden furniture comes in a variety of materials, each with its own unique characteristics. Popular choices include wood (teak, acacia, eucalyptus), metal (aluminum, wrought iron, steel), plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene), and wicker (natural, synthetic). Consider factors like durability, weather resistance, maintenance, and personal style when selecting the right material for your garden furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  <b>Answer:</b> Measure the available space in your garden and consider the number of people you want to accommodate. Choose furniture pieces that are proportionate to the size of your garden and allow for comfortable movement. It's also important to consider the size of your doorways and gates to ensure that the furniture can be easily moved in and out.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  <b>Answer:</b> Regular maintenance will help keep your garden furniture looking its best and extend its lifespan. Clean the furniture regularly with mild soap and water. For wooden furniture, apply a sealant or oil to protect it from moisture and UV damage. Metal furniture may require occasional rust removal and repainting. Plastic and wicker furniture are generally low-maintenance, but they should be protected from extreme weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  <b>Answer:</b> The durability of your garden furniture will determine whether it can withstand outdoor conditions all year round. Metal furniture, especially iron and steel, is prone to rust if left exposed to moisture. Wooden furniture should be treated with a sealant or oil to protect it from moisture and UV damage. Plastic and wicker furniture are generally more resistant to outdoor elements, but they should be protected from extreme weather conditions.
