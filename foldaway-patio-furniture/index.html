    <strong>Clean your furniture regularly.</strong> Use a mild detergent and water solution to clean the furniture. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can damage the finish.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong> If possible, store your furniture in a dry place when not in use. If you cannot store the furniture indoors, use a furniture cover to protect it from the sun, rain, and snow.
