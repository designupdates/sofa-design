  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quick-drying Cushions:</strong><br />

      Modular rattan garden furniture often comes with cushions made from quick-drying materials like polyester or acrylic. These cushions are designed to resist moisture and dry quickly after rain or spills, making them easy to maintain.

  When choosing garden furniture, consider the material carefully. Different materials have different advantages and disadvantages.
