      PE rattan is a synthetic fiber made from high-density polyethylene. It is UV-resistant, water-resistant, and extremely durable. PE rattan furniture can withstand harsh weather conditions, including rain, snow, and intense sunlight, without fading or cracking.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quick-drying Cushions:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Modular rattan garden furniture often comes with cushions made from quick-drying materials like polyester or acrylic. These cushions are designed to resist moisture and dry quickly after rain or spills, making them easy to maintain.
    </p>
  </li>

    <strong>Adaptable to Different Spaces:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Its portability makes modular rattan furniture ideal for spaces with limited room. You can easily move the modules to create different configurations, making it suitable for balconies, patios, and even small gardens. You can also easily store the furniture away when not in use.
    </p>
  </li>

    <strong>Convenient for Cleaning and Maintenance:</strong><br />

  When choosing garden furniture, consider the material carefully. Different materials have different advantages and disadvantages.
