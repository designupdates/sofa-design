  <strong>Welcome to our FAQ section dedicated to garden furniture!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you make informed decisions about choosing, maintaining, and enjoying your outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Answer 1: Garden furniture comes in a variety of materials, each with its own unique properties and benefits. Common materials include wood (teak, acacia, eucalyptus), metal (wrought iron, aluminum, stainless steel), plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene), and wicker (natural rattan, synthetic rattan).
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my space?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Answer 2: Consider the size and layout of your garden, as well as your personal style and needs. Choose pieces that are proportional to the space and that complement your outdoor dÃ©cor. Think about the functionality you want, such as seating, dining, or lounging, and select furniture that accommodates your activities.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Answer 3: To ensure the longevity of your garden furniture, protect it from harsh weather conditions. Use covers or cushions when not in use, especially during rain or extreme heat. Regularly clean and maintain your furniture to prevent rust, fading, or cracking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I clean and maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong>

  Answer 4: Cleaning and maintenance routines vary depending on the material of your garden furniture. Generally, use mild soap and water for regular cleaning. For tougher stains or dirt, consult the manufacturer's recommendations for specific cleaning solutions and techniques.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I leave my garden furniture outdoors all year round?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Answer 5: The durability of your garden furniture depends on the material and construction. Some materials, like teak or aluminum, are more resistant to outdoor conditions and can withstand year-round exposure. However, it's generally advisable to store furniture indoors or use protective covers during harsh weather to prolong its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
