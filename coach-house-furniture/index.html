<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a popular choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and weather resistance. Plastic is a low-maintenance option that is available in a wide range of colors and styles. Wicker is a natural material that adds a touch of bohemian charm to any outdoor space.

  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing garden furniture, consider the following factors: the size of your outdoor space, the intended use of the furniture, your personal style, and your budget. Measure your space carefully to ensure that the furniture you choose fits comfortably. Think about how you will be using the furniture, whether it's for dining, lounging, or entertaining guests. Choose a style that complements your home and garden décor. And finally, set a budget and stick to it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best way to maintain your garden furniture is to clean it regularly. Use a mild soap and water solution and a soft cloth to wipe down the furniture.

</p>

Disassemble the furniture if possible to make it easier to store. Store the furniture in a dry, sheltered place, such as a garage or shed. You may want to cover the furniture with a tarp or plastic sheeting to protect it from dust and moisture.
</p>
