  <li>
    <strong>Corner blocks</strong><br />

    <strong>Metal hardware</strong><br />

    <strong>Acanthus leaves</strong><br />
    <p>
      Acanthus leaves are a common motif in Mason furniture carvings. These leaves are characterized by their deeply lobed edges and serrated margins. They are often used to decorate the arms, legs, and backs of chairs, sofas, and other pieces of furniture.
