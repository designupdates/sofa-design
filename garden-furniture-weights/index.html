Even heavier furniture can be susceptible to being blown over in strong winds, especially if it is not properly secured.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents furniture from being blown away</strong><br />
    <p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Keeps furniture stable</strong><br />
    <p>
      Garden furniture weights also help to keep your furniture stable, even in windy conditions. This is because the weights help to distribute the weight of the furniture more evenly, which makes it less likely to tip over.
