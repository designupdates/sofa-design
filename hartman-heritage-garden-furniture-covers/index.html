  Durable materials for long-lasting protection
</h3>
<p>
  Hartman Heritage garden furniture covers are made from durable, high-quality materials that are designed to withstand the rigors of outdoor exposure and provide long-lasting protection for your furniture.
</p>
<p>
  The outer layer of the covers is typically made from a tough, woven polyester fabric that is resistant to tearing and abrasion. This fabric is also treated with a UV-resistant coating to prevent fading and degradation from the sun's harmful rays.
</p>
<p>
  The inner layer of the covers is often made from a soft, non-woven fabric that is gentle on your furniture's finish. This layer helps to prevent scratches and scuffs, and it also helps to absorb moisture and prevent condensation from forming inside the cover.
</p>
<p>
  The covers are also double-stitched for added strength and durability, and they feature reinforced seams at stress points to prevent tearing. This ensures that your covers will last for many seasons to come, providing reliable protection for your valuable furniture.

<p>
  In addition to their durable construction, Hartman Heritage garden furniture covers are also waterproof and breathable. This means that they will protect your furniture from rain, snow, and other moisture, while still allowing air to circulate and prevent mold and mildew from forming.
