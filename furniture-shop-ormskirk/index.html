<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The material of your garden furniture will determine its durability, weather resistance, and appearance. Consider the following factors when choosing a material:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wood:</strong> Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture. It is strong, durable, and has a natural look. However, wood requires regular maintenance to protect it from rot and decay.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Metal:</strong> Metal garden furniture is durable and weather-resistant. It is also easy to clean and maintain. However, metal can be hot to the touch in direct sunlight.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic:</strong> Plastic garden furniture is lightweight, affordable, and easy to maintain. However, plastic can be flimsy and may not be as durable as other materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rattan:</strong> Rattan garden furniture is natural and eco-friendly. It is also strong and durable. However, rattan can be expensive and requires regular maintenance.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Measure your space.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Before you start shopping for garden furniture, measure your space to determine how much furniture you can fit. Make sure to leave enough room for people to walk around and for doors and gates to open and close easily.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Choose comfortable furniture.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You'll be spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, so make sure it's comfortable. Choose furniture with cushions that are firm enough to provide support but soft enough to be comfortable. You may also want to consider furniture with adjustable backs and armrests.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you live in an area with harsh weather, you'll need to protect your garden furniture from the elements. This means covering it with tarps or furniture covers when it's not in use. You may also want to consider storing your furniture indoors during the winter months.
</p>
