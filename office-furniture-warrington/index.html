  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjustable desks:</strong> If possible, choose a desk that allows you to adjust the height so that your feet are flat on the floor and your elbows are at a 90-degree angle when typing. This will help reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) like carpal tunnel syndrome.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Footrests:</strong> If your feet don't touch the floor comfortably when seated, consider using a footrest to support your feet and improve circulation.

  By investing in comfortable office furniture in Warrington, you'll be creating a workspace that supports your physical well-being and helps you stay productive throughout the day.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Take breaks:</strong> Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes to prevent muscle strain and fatigue. Take short walks, stretch, or do some light exercises to keep your body active.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use ergonomic accessories:</strong> Consider using ergonomic accessories like a keyboard tray, mouse pad, and footrest to further improve your posture and comfort.
  </li>

  By incorporating ergonomic principles into your office furniture in Warrington, you'll be creating a workspace that supports your physical well-being and helps you work more productively and comfortably.
